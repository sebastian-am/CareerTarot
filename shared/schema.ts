If you could tell us where you went to school and how you got even that experience in the ambulance?   Kayla Baumgartner  2:04   Sure, so I believe it or not, I have not always wanted to do this as my profession. My dad was a volunteer firefighter for many years, and it was just something that I kind of walked into being a CrossFit trainer. But prior to that, I had a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Physiology, so I had kind of like an idea of how the body worked. So my first intro to kind of getting into the medical world was going through EMT school, and I picked a program that was only 10 weeks. And I know that programs now can even be like as short as three weeks. I would not recommend that. I would recommend going for something a little lengthier, especially if you don't have a lot of experience. So I went through the EMT program, which is a very basic, you know, Intro to being kind of like a first responder. After that, I went right into paramedic school, which I also don't recommend. I would probably work on an ambulance for a while, but I was really eager to kind of get a kickstart into the career. And so I knew, in order to be a firefighter, I'm like, I've got to get that license. I have to be a paramedic. So went straight from the EMT program into a year and a half of paramedic school. And during that time in medic school, just kind of like any sort of nursing program or going to PA school, you have different sections of school. So you have a classroom portion, you have a little portion in the hospital to just get more patient contacts and practice your skills, and then you go out into the field and are on an ambulance. And that's your internship. So it's, it's a lengthy process. The internship I went through was 720 hours. Oh, my God. So it took me about six months to get through that, but I also had no experience prior to that working on any so",

We have developed a curriculum and an application, pretty much hand-in-hand, with students and schools for the last three years. And we've applied what's called the Lean Methodology to developing the app and curriculum. Essentially, it just means that you do a lot of testing, that you build a minimum viable product which is just something that works, that does the core value that you're trying to present to your customer. And you take that to them, you put it in their hands, and you see how they react to it. And you listen to them, and then you kind of go back to the drawing board, you figure out what you can adjust to make it better, and then you release a new iteration as quickly as possible.    And so for our first year that we were working with schools and kids, we didn't charge anybody a penny, because we knew our software and curriculum were pretty bad. But we knew that through working with everybody, we could learn enough to make it much better.    So that's essentially kind of how we've gotten here.

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer 2:14  And schools are now trying, they're now implementing it in the classroom?    Sukh Singh 2:17  Yeah, so this year we have, I believe it's six different schools in Santa Cruz County, from Pajaro all the way up to Scotts Valley, where teachers are independently teaching with our software. Where it's teachers that have never taught computer science before. Teachers that come from a social science or English background. And so originally when we started, we thought that our app and our curriculum would fit really well into a math classroom because a lot of the concepts that students are applying fit directly along with common core math for third to eighth grade. But what we found when we started approaching math teachers is that often they were too busy. They had a lot on their plates already and they couldn't really make time for coding. But there were a lot of social science teachers that were really interested in this idea of empathy, this idea of growth mindset, this idea of being like an empathetic learner, and so they took on the challenge of learning to code themselves and they kind of learned to code with their students. And we've actually found that to be kind of the best way forward because then students see their teachers fail, the teachers developing a portfolio along with their students, everyone's at the table. Students are getting to teach their teachers, everyone's kind of getting to go at their own pace and that's okay.   And so we've really seen that trend kind of developing as of last year in 2018. And since we've decided that we should really be serving that group and that population, because they are so motivated, and they are so excited. Third to eighth grade, specifically Social Science, English, and history teachers. So teachers that have never programmed before. And that's mainly just so students can see their teachers fail. And so it can pull in those students that have a lot of reservations about math, programming, or engineering. When they see a history or an English or a social science teacher, they can see themselves in that teacher, they can see themselves being like, \u201cYou know, I wasn't sure about this, but they weren't really sure about this either\u201d. And I think that gives a lot of those kids buy-in where they might not have had it if it was like, let's say, a math teacher teaching it. Where they might even register for the class because \u201cI hate this algebra class.",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer 4:22  So, you provide coding software and curriculum to teachers and schools, right? And they teach it to their students.    Sukh Singh 4:28 Exactly.    # HOW IT WORKS Interviewer 4:29  Okay. And then what kind of coding and software to your brain\u2013 like, how complex is it?    Sukh Singh 4:34  So we provide students a web application, that essentially means that it's used through a browser. When we originally started developing, we had made a Windows-specific application. But then when we started working with schools, we realized that everyone has Chromebooks. Like everyone has a one-to-one on Chromebooks pretty much. And so we read about the application kind of around the Chromebooks and around tools that schools and teachers already had. And so each student has their own portfolio where they can kind of build their own projects. And so each student can program in JavaScript, they can learn at their own pace, they can make as many projects as they want. There's a beginner and an advanced version where they can kind of like get their bearings, and then move into advanced and start making little applications, games, animations, comics. Like they make really cool stuff in advance.    And so that's the main software that we give the students. And then we have a whole series of lessons broken up over five levels that we give to teachers to distribute to students how they want. And so teachers, essentially, print out worksheets or print out project breakdowns as they need to. And so we originally started, we never assumed that we would be the people that would create that kind of material. We originally thought that we would kind of just create, like a platform where students could be creative and make stuff. But as we started working with kids, we realized if we created that material hand in hand with them, it could make sense specifically for them. And so it's been great to be able to build worksheets and build project outlines, and then actually just hand it to a student and see how they react to it and how they like\u2013 they're so blunt. Like, they'll just tell you, \u201cthis sucks. This does make any sense\u201d. And you're like, \u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Like, it's perfect feedback. And so you can go back and actually change it. And teachers really seem to benefit from that. A lot of our teachers, you know, make it a point to tell us that they can see that this has been tested before, that they can see that this already works for their students because when their kids get it, they can start using it instantly.    And so that curriculum is provided currently digitally. But for the 2019-2020 school year, we're actually publishing a workbook. So that's our big project. A few of our schools are already using the workbook and like a prototype, and they've given us really good feedback. But the idea is to make the class as similar to teaching social studies history or any class as possible. I think a lot of education technology, and a lot of these big startups, try to reinvent how people do things. And we forget how great teachers already are at teaching. They\u2019re already the experts at that specifically. And so if we can build computer science curriculum in a way that they're used to getting curriculum, and in a way where they're used to structuring a class, that way, it removes that burden from them. And so originally, in our first year and a half, we tried to do that, we tried to rebuild the wheel, and some teachers bought in, and some teachers were willing to do it, but we realize how much strain we were putting on them, and how difficult that is when you have like five or six classes to teach. And so we've kind of switched our perspective. And really, now the curriculum is supposed to be as similar to teaching any other class where it's broken down:  You have your standard alignment, you have something that you can do each day, the reflections that students can do, there's a rubric to grade, students can be working at different levels, but be graded in like some kind of equitable manner, students can actually do presentations, just like they would do in history, where they would put together a Google slide, where they're explaining, like all of the context behind where they got their project idea why they pursued it, what concepts they use. And so, all of that was stuff that we didn't realize that we were gonna have to do until we saw teachers struggling in the classroom. And then it was just thanks to them being super honest. They're like, \u201cAll this is really hard for me because of reason a, y, and z.",

Like, they'll just tell you, \u201cthis sucks. This does make any sense\u201d. And you're like, \u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Like, it's perfect feedback. And so you can go back and actually change it. And teachers really seem to benefit from that. A lot of our teachers, you know, make it a point to tell us that they can see that this has been tested before, that they can see that this already works for their students because when their kids get it, they can start using it instantly.    And so that curriculum is provided currently digitally. But for the 2019-2020 school year, we're actually publishing a workbook. So that's our big project. A few of our schools are already using the workbook and like a prototype, and they've given us really good feedback. But the idea is to make the class as similar to teaching social studies history or any class as possible. I think a lot of education technology, and a lot of these big startups, try to reinvent how people do things. And we forget how great teachers already are at teaching. They\u2019re already the experts at that specifically. And so if we can build computer science curriculum in a way that they're used to getting curriculum, and in a way where they're used to structuring a class, that way, it removes that burden from them. And so originally, in our first year and a half, we tried to do that, we tried to rebuild the wheel, and some teachers bought in, and some teachers were willing to do it, but we realize how much strain we were putting on them, and how difficult that is when you have like five or six classes to teach. And so we've kind of switched our perspective. And really, now the curriculum is supposed to be as similar to teaching any other class where it's broken down:  You have your standard alignment, you have something that you can do each day, the reflections that students can do, there's a rubric to grade, students can be working at different levels, but be graded in like some kind of equitable manner, students can actually do presentations, just like they would do in history, where they would put together a Google slide, where they're explaining, like all of the context behind where they got their project idea why they pursued it, what concepts they use. And so, all of that was stuff that we didn't realize that we were gonna have to do until we saw teachers struggling in the classroom. And then it was just thanks to them being super honest.

Sukh Singh 4:34  So we provide students a web application, that essentially means that it's used through a browser. When we originally started developing, we had made a Windows-specific application. But then when we started working with schools, we realized that everyone has Chromebooks. Like everyone has a one-to-one on Chromebooks pretty much. And so we read about the application kind of around the Chromebooks and around tools that schools and teachers already had. And so each student has their own portfolio where they can kind of build their own projects. And so each student can program in JavaScript, they can learn at their own pace, they can make as many projects as they want. There's a beginner and an advanced version where they can kind of like get their bearings, and then move into advanced and start making little applications, games, animations, comics. Like they make really cool stuff in advance.    And so that's the main software that we give the students. And then we have a whole series of lessons broken up over five levels that we give to teachers to distribute to students how they want. And so teachers, essentially, print out worksheets or print out project breakdowns as they need to.

I mean, I think when you talk about innovation, it's always about how something can be so new and so different. But if you think about like all of our, like, favorite innovations, it's like they fit into our life in a way where it's like, seamless. Like, a touchscreen phone is so easy to use. An iPad is so simple, and you pick it up. It's like a lot of the other things that you already do. And so like that's the tweak that we want to provide for teachers. We are super confident that any teacher can teach the class how to program because they can learn it along with them. And a lot of it is about failure.

I'm Melina and I'm joined by our other host, Nick. We're speaking with Sukh Singh, who is the CEO of Code Naturally, and he was just telling us about the Code Naturally program curriculum and how mostly third to eighth-grader students and social science English teachers enjoy that more than the math teachers. Right. And also you're about to get into the challenges and the failures, right? Can you tell us more about that? How did you come up with this concept? And what kind of was the drive behind?   Sukh Singh 9:49  Yeah, sure. So, the drive behind it was I never actually got to see computer science or programming when I was in high school or middle school. I was always really into computers. I was really into hardware stuff. I was the person that would go and fix my friend's computer to the broken, mainly with anti-viruses, right? It's the simplest thing. Yeah. But I never knew that there was a such thing as programming. It just I never connected the dots. And when I got to college, and I took my first class, I failed miserably. And it was the first time that like, failed the class so handedly. It was just the first,  like CS 12A . I mean, there was one easier class that I could have taken that probably should have. My overconfidence really shot me in the foot. But I failed that class and a lot of it was just because I hadn't seen it before. And the way that I approached it, I kept thinking about solving a problem. And I didn't think of it as communicating, which is a lot more like what you're doing when you're programming. You're communicating your intentions through a really a formulated language, right? Like, if you were if you had a friend who was drawing on the board for you, you could just be like, hey, draw a red square on the board, and they would probably get somewhere close to what you wanted, like computers really stupid. So you have to get really specific and be like, \u201cI need you to draw\u2026 at this specific point\u201d. Yeah. And that's something that I didn't understand when I took that class.    And so afterwards, I thought that if students could have that experience at a younger age, that things would be different for them. I all I really wanted them to understand was that programming is communicating and not problem-solving. You don't have to think about it as math, There really is a separation. I think students like tell me \u201cI hate math, math is stupid\u201d. They don't hate math, they hate calculating, which is fair, like no one likes calculating right?",

Which I mean, it's tempting. I mean, like, especially when you're working with kids, like I spend, I would say, at least 15 to 20 hours every week with students that are between third to eighth grade that I've known, that I've seen grow up for the last three years. So they are like, very comfortable in making their demands. But these are also because they've been programming for three years. If I build features, and I build software for those kids, it's gonna make it so much less interesting and less appealing to those students that are just starting. And so for us, it's so much more important to focus on that first mile experience, what's it going to be like, as you're just starting to program, what allowed our other students to be successful? And so like some things that we've seen is that like, when students can make about eight projects within their first week, then generally speaking, they'll continue to go on to make significantly more, right, if they can successfully write their first couple of lines of code within like five-ish minutes. If they can learn how to copy and paste, right, and so like, for like, as we get ready to release the newest iteration of our app, it's, those are things that I'm focused on, like, how can I get them to have all those little experiences? So that way, they're set up for success, and they feel successful? Because I feel like you know, for us, that's what our goal is, is like, how can we get as many students interested and excited about this? Not just how can we get the students that are really bright, really motivated, and really interested? How can we continue to feed those students, because those students are going to be fine. They're already such prolific learners, it's really everyone else that I think that we need to kind of bring into the fold.

So what's the most, maybe a hurdle you went through? Sukh Singh 25:49 Sure. So we're a bootstrap startup. And so that means that we support ourselves through actually generating revenue for the last three years. And as someone that's just kind of like starting up a company, that's very difficult. That's been something that's been a consistent hurdle for us. And like, the only way that we got through our first year was thanks to, you know, thanks to family. And thanks to Airbnb, because we just got really good at doing sheets and Airbnb in our master bedroom. And that totally paid our rent for the entire first year that we did our business.

And so, we realized that schools have at least a year-long decision-making cycles. And so those sales were never going to happen fast. But we realized that as we started working with schools, and with kids more and more, there was a ton of demand for computer science and STEM education for kids. And so more and more parents kept asking, Are you guys going to do a summer camp? Are you guys going to do after school? How can my kid keep doing this, they need help to learn this. And so our parents literally told us that they would pay for it. And so we made the program, it was kind of like the opposite of that whole, like, you know, if you build it, they will come. There were already people that were asking for this kind of program. And so we built out summer programs, we built our after school programs. And as they got enrolled, we were able to use that revenue not only to make rent, but to you know, continue to invest into our curriculum and into our application to kind of actually develop something that supports students at any level.

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  14:39   So as a college representative, what are your duties? What do you do?   Brooke  14:44   Well, I one thing I love about my job is because I work in the community and Educational Affairs Department. We're given the freedom to do different kinds of presentations. So we have historical one's like on the history and fashion of France. Like Louie the 14th was the first to wear the high heel and popularized Leonardo da Vinci was one man that worked on the invention of the high heel. There's some pretty cool history. We do you know, the history of modern American dress and how World War II really allowed women to wear pants yet, even here in Santa Cruz, Going to high school in the 60s, my older cousins were the 60s, they couldn't wear pants to school. So there was like this huge revolution in 1970, when all the girls started wearing pants, so it allows me the job itself allows me to kind of venture out, we do professional development, workshops, social media management workshops, visual communications workshops. So the job continues, you know, continuously requires me to learn. And, you know, working with teens and younger students is always refreshing, like my knowledge and giving me a different point of view. So I really enjoy and appreciate, you know, what that brings into my life, just the understanding of kind of like, what's happening right now?   Interviewer  16:25   Do you have a favorite memory that comes to mind led to this career to this job?   Brooke  16:31   Let me think, well, Getting those cookies from Mrs. Oh, you know, I think just being able to, like really feel like I had a sense of community with other people that I work with. I am what is called like a, you know, out in the field. So, you know, we are field workers. So we don't always see our co workers, but because I have stayed with the job for a long time, I really develop close relationships. So that on a personal level has been really fulfilling. And then of course, working with students who have found like, Oh, this is it, like, that's what I want to do, and like myself, not really realizing that you can do it. So I think, you know, when I think of the students that I've met, that have just had that insight, that was definitely probably the most rewarding is just, you know, share, you know, sharing with them and their families that this is a huge, multi multibillion dollar global industry, and that there is so much opportunity. So many people have been encouraged to go into STEM, that we have a real need for designers. So there are 1000s of jobs now open in the design fields, because people choosing law or medicine, or some other fields.   Interviewer  18:14   have you faced any challenges in this career?   Brooke  18:17   It it's always well, it's always challenging to keep the audience in this case, teenagers inspired and connected. Technology has certainly come, you know, competes for attention. So that's something that's very challenging, building awareness. So it's not only teenagers that may not know about this industry, but educators, administrators, the general public, and I think it's it, unfortunately, the art and design of the things that we own and value haven't really been given the value, the people that create them here haven't been given the value that perhaps they need to be recognized for. If you go to Europe, a fashion designer is the equivalent to like a lawyer or a doctor, they're very highly esteemed, they're artists. And here, you know, the United States we, I think just take them for granted, you know, like it just happens or something. So So that's challenging.   Interviewer  19:32   Did you always know you were gonna go into fashion as a high school or what was your as a high schooler? What was your like life plan?   Brooke  19:39   Well, again, I think, like a lot of people I kind of focused on more of a grandiose vision of maybe what I would be doing. And I mean, my, my vision My goal has never really changed. I mean, my emphasis is to make the world a better place. To maybe bring more hope and beauty to the planet. Originally, as I mentioned, I saw that maybe by innovating the news, like instead of like turning on the the nightly news as a broadcaster to gloom and doom, you know, why don't we talk about, like, all the amazing things that are happening, like, because I think it is a social psychology, you know, the more negative things that we think about the more maybe they manifest. So, of course, my instructor said, that's a ridiculous idea, you shouldn't do that. So I kind of got dissuade by that. But I knew I didn't actually really think and that's why because I don't think I knew about it.  Like even interior design, you know, creating everything from healing environments, you know, you can use color, like a moth pink is one of the most soothing, yeah, blue is calming, red, you know, can actually induce anxiety. Orange is will make you hungry. Yeah. So, you know, every color has its association, you know, black can absolutely be sophisticated. But if you surround yourself in too much black, it can, you know, start to pull you into the darkness a little bit more. So, yellow, so you can counter that with a little yellow, which will make you feel cheerful. So, you know, a green, you know, is growing. So there's and then it gets even down to the specific shade. Yeah. So it's, and there are people that just do that for a living, you know, they they only work with color.",

Originally, as I mentioned, I saw that maybe by innovating the news, like instead of like turning on the the nightly news as a broadcaster to gloom and doom, you know, why don't we talk about, like, all the amazing things that are happening, like, because I think it is a social psychology, you know, the more negative things that we think about the more maybe they manifest. So, of course, my instructor said, that's a ridiculous idea, you shouldn't do that. So I kind of got dissuade by that. But I knew I didn't actually really think and that's why because I don't think I knew about it.  Like even interior design, you know, creating everything from healing environments, you know, you can use color, like a moth pink is one of the most soothing, yeah, blue is calming, red, you know, can actually induce anxiety. Orange is will make you hungry. Yeah. So, you know, every color has its association, you know, black can absolutely be sophisticated. But if you surround yourself in too much black, it can, you know, start to pull you into the darkness a little bit more. So, yellow, so you can counter that with a little yellow, which will make you feel cheerful. So, you know, a green, you know, is growing. So there's and then it gets even down to the specific shade. Yeah. So it's, and there are people that just do that for a living, you know, they they only work with color.",

Brooke  14:44   Well, I one thing I love about my job is because I work in the community and Educational Affairs Department. We're given the freedom to do different kinds of presentations. So we have historical one's like on the history and fashion of France. Like Louie the 14th was the first to wear the high heel and popularized Leonardo da Vinci was one man that worked on the invention of the high heel. There's some pretty cool history. We do you know, the history of modern American dress and how World War II really allowed women to wear pants yet, even here in Santa Cruz, Going to high school in the 60s, my older cousins were the 60s, they couldn't wear pants to school. So there was like this huge revolution in 1970, when all the girls started wearing pants, so it allows me the job itself allows me to kind of venture out, we do professional development, workshops, social media management workshops, visual communications workshops. So the job continues, you know, continuously requires me to learn. And, you know, working with teens and younger students is always refreshing, like my knowledge and giving me a different point of view. So I really enjoy and appreciate, you know, what that brings into my life, just the understanding of kind of like, what's happening right now?   Interviewer  16:25   Do you have a favorite memory that comes to mind led to this career to this job?   Brooke  16:31   Let me think, well, Getting those cookies from Mrs. Oh, you know, I think just being able to, like really feel like I had a sense of community with other people that I work with. I am what is called like a, you know, out in the field. So, you know, we are field workers. So we don't always see our co workers, but because I have stayed with the job for a long time, I really develop close relationships. So that on a personal level has been really fulfilling. And then of course, working with students who have found like, Oh, this is it, like, that's what I want to do, and like myself, not really realizing that you can do it. So I think, you know, when I think of the students that I've met, that have just had that insight, that was definitely probably the most rewarding is just, you know, share, you know, sharing with them and their families that this is a huge, multi multibillion dollar global industry, and that there is so much opportunity. So many people have been encouraged to go into STEM, that we have a real need for designers. So there are 1000s of jobs now open in the design fields, because people choosing law or medicine, or some other fields.   Interviewer  18:14   have you faced any challenges in this career?   Brooke  18:17   It it's always well, it's always challenging to keep the audience in this case, teenagers inspired and connected. Technology has certainly come, you know, competes for attention. So that's something that's very challenging, building awareness. So it's not only teenagers that may not know about this industry, but educators, administrators, the general public, and I think it's it, unfortunately, the art and design of the things that we own and value haven't really been given the value, the people that create them here haven't been given the value that perhaps they need to be recognized for. If you go to Europe, a fashion designer is the equivalent to like a lawyer or a doctor, they're very highly esteemed, they're artists. And here, you know, the United States we, I think just take them for granted, you know, like it just happens or something. So So that's challenging.   Interviewer  19:32   Did you always know you were gonna go into fashion as a high school or what was your as a high schooler? What was your like life plan?

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Question: So could you walk us, I guess, through your education? Sure. Your journey towards the Chief Operating Officer? Answer: Yeah, I mean, Journey is the correct way to describe it. So yeah, I went to Aptos high. And afterwards, attended Santa Clara University, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor, started as a chemistry major. Got a C in organic chemistry and was devastated. Thought I could never become a doctor and dropped all my science classes and took a random set of classes, and one of them being economics, and I enjoyed it. So I continued on studying economics. The interesting part was for me, I was already in the School of Arts and Sciences. So I didn't take any business. That economics was either in the business school or arts and sciences, so I didn't have any business classes. And afterwards, I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do. So I took a job as a financial analyst at a semiconductor company. And the unique situation there was it was a rotational program. So I was able to rotate through a bunch of departments within the company. And so I got a great, great exposure to all kinds of different accounting and finance type positions in the semiconductor company. From there, I decided to move back to Santa Cruz because I missed despite not being that far away, I just miss living on this side of the hill. And I started working for my dad's company that always kind of worked at. That was kind of my summer job. He has a whole he had a wholesale meat distributorship. So I, you know, I continue to work with him because ultimately, the person that he was kind of his main person ended up leaving for various reasons, and I kind of filled that position. And from there, you did a lot of all kinds of things at the company from our accounting or finance or sales, purchasing, just kind of general operations. And it's, I don't know if either of you have ever worked with family, it can be difficult. So I worked there for almost eight years and decided that I needed to change. And I went back to Santa Clara and got a Certificate of Advanced Accounting proficiency, which allowed me to take the CPA and get my CPA certificate or license. And from there I worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is a large, global accounting firm and really thought that I was going to pursue a career as a CPA, but after a year decided that I wanted to be more on in India Isn't it's rather than just a consultant and rather than just someone that was presumptive providing a service. So as I said, it was a journey. So I bought a few businesses after that. Went back working for my dad, and then ended up at Verve after I sold those businesses.",

Answer: Yeah, I mean, Journey is the correct way to describe it. So yeah, I went to Aptos high. And afterwards, attended Santa Clara University, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor, started as a chemistry major. Got a C in organic chemistry and was devastated. Thought I could never become a doctor and dropped all my science classes and took a random set of classes, and one of them being economics, and I enjoyed it. So I continued on studying economics. The interesting part was for me, I was already in the School of Arts and Sciences. So I didn't take any business. That economics was either in the business school or arts and sciences, so I didn't have any business classes. And afterwards, I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do. So I took a job as a financial analyst at a semiconductor company. And the unique situation there was it was a rotational program. So I was able to rotate through a bunch of departments within the company. And so I got a great, great exposure to all kinds of different accounting and finance type positions in the semiconductor company. From there, I decided to move back to Santa Cruz because I missed despite not being that far away, I just miss living on this side of the hill. And I started working for my dad's company that always kind of worked at. That was kind of my summer job. He has a whole he had a wholesale meat distributorship. So I, you know, I continue to work with him because ultimately, the person that he was kind of his main person ended up leaving for various reasons, and I kind of filled that position. And from there, you did a lot of all kinds of things at the company from our accounting or finance or sales, purchasing, just kind of general operations. And it's, I don't know if either of you have ever worked with family, it can be difficult. So I worked there for almost eight years and decided that I needed to change. And I went back to Santa Clara and got a Certificate of Advanced Accounting proficiency, which allowed me to take the CPA and get my CPA certificate or license. And from there I worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is a large, global accounting firm and really thought that I was going to pursue a career as a CPA, but after a year decided that I wanted to be more on in India Isn't it's rather than just a consultant and rather than just someone that was presumptive providing a service. So as I said, it was a journey. So I bought a few businesses after that. Went back working for my dad, and then ended up at Verve after I sold those businesses.",

We develop even even within retail, we kind of develop other pathways. So if you don't want to go into management in retail, there's educational opportunities, you know, because we have to train all of our staff. So we have trainers, there's sales opportunities, because we have a wholesale department. There, we have a lot of internal marketing, a lot of internal web design, and there's purchasing, whether it be the green coffee or just for our, you know, supplies and whatnot that go into our cafes.

So, yeah, it's operations is a very interesting career path, if you just like to have a wide scope of business, and like to, in general, kind of drive things forward. And then accounting. You know, if you're interested in business, I didn't, I didn't get into accounting until after I was part of my family's business for eight years, I honestly dropped my only accounting class in undergrad.

I have a staff that I work with. I first of all work in a housing complex, affordable housing. We do activities for the residents. So, something I do during the school year is have an out-of-school time for our kids, our youth. We also, for our adults that live there, do curriculum as well. Like, we have San Jose State School of Nursing that comes down and checks on our residents, vital signs, helps them understand their meds if they have meds, helps them with basically anything. I have a resident that doesn't know how to read and she needed distilled water. She never knew what distilled water was because she didn't know how to read. So the students helped out by showing her a picture. She would always go to the store with a picture until she found the one that matched what it said.  We also do other things like community events where I partner with the Santa Cruz Parks and Rec, Louden Nelson Teen Center, Nueva Vista Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Cruz. We hold activities in the summer for kids. Our partnership with Parks and Rec lets us go swimming at the Harvey West pool site. It's completely free to us. It's paid for by Friends of Parks and Rec. Also, our committee comes together once a year and does one huge party. It's called The Family Fair where we have barbecue, a jump house, a dunk tank, swimming pools are open and the park that we're using. It's absolutely free to anybody that comes.  In my personal time, I help people with any kind of situation, if they need help with understanding their medical records, I can help them go to the medical appointments and help them understand it. I do all kinds of translations. There's so much that I do as the manager though. I also work with my staff, and I guide them on how to do their jobs as well. I'm actually training a brand new staff member. She's only a week into the job. I also do conflict resolution. It's a whole bunch of stuff that I do that's really rewarding and also challenging, and it gets to you personally and on a personal level.",

So, I originally started at Footlocker and I was like, Is this still my life? But my cousin, who I was very close to, I had just barely come back from vacation, visiting him in Arizona. Two days later, he was actually hit by a car. The police thought he was dead. So, they left him there and they did not do any life resuscitation stuff for him. When they saw him moving and trying to actually get up, that's when they did everything. As a result, he went five minutes without oxygen, and he became brain-damaged. He has a traumatic brain injury now, and that kind of... he was my best friend. So, I wanted to learn everything that he was going through. I ended up working with people with disabilities, and I started learning that route. Then I was like, Wow, I love this so much. I thought, I need to get a degree in social work so that I can be a social worker and do this work for people to help out. And I've had a ball ever since.  I got my degree in Human Services. Quite funny, because as soon as I got my degree, I actually got recruited by Mercy Housing. My supervisor at the time came over and asked, Hey, are you looking for a new job?

Mercy Housing was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of Omaha, Nebraska. They believed that people needed more than just affordable housing to survive. So, they came up with resident services. From there, that's how we went on to doing what we do now. Our focus is on health and wellness. Anything that's done with health and wellness, like the nurse visits that we have, we have food that comes out to our properties and stuff like that. Something really cool is that I'm bringing a dental program to our sites that will be affordable for our residents to use. We also believe in housing stability. If our residents can afford to pay the rent, that's what we're there for, to help them find resources. We also do financial stability seminars with them. We do a book called Your Money, Your Goals, which tracks where their money goes for the vast majority of the time. A real big key component right now that we're pushing is out-of-school time. Our kids are the future. How are we going to mold them to be great people in the future?  I remember when I first got to my site, one of my kids came up to me and said, Hey, I'm going to work at McDonald's and live with my family. And I remember saying, Oh, no, no, no, that's never going to work. So, I reached out to UCSC to have kids from equally, you know, backgrounds of affordable housing types to come out and show that they come to UCSC for school. These kids can be bigger and better. As a result, I have had one of my kids graduate from college, UC Santa Barbara. I was invited to his graduation two weeks ago.",

We take them to the movies. We do a lot of different things during the summer with our kids. We also do resident meetings. Yesterday, one of our property managers was actually leaving today. So, we threw her a going-away party, and the whole entire community came in and brought so much great food. I was in food coma mode for a while. It's all about the connection. For example, yesterday, we were passing out flyers because we make flyers for everyone, a calendar of events of what we do for the residents. In walking, I ran into like two or three different families. I'm like, You're going to take your kids swimming, right? You're going to come with us? And they're like, Yeah, sure.

Can you tell us more about what inspires you to come to work every day and what you love most about it?  Jose Ybarra 08:42 What inspires me to come to work every day is basically knowing that I'm going to change at least one person's life every single day. I have seen a lot of lives changed because of the services that we provide. For example, we get an intern from UCSC every year. One of our interns was struggling because she didn't know what she wanted to do. By the time she finished, she said, I know exactly what I want to do now. I want to be a social worker. So that changed her entire trajectory of what she wanted to do in life. Now she's going to go help people out. I remember another resident who used to be shy and introverted. We got her into a program where she started learning English. She came to me one day and said, I have my first job interview. She got the job, and she's now working and thriving. It's seeing those successes that keep me going every day.",

My role is to do the fundraising. Each year we need to raise about $1.5 million.

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 4:47 Before being the Development Director, I was the Visitor Programs Manager at the Seymour Center, training volunteer docents and exhibit guides. We have over 250 active volunteers who interact with the public. Prior to the Seymour Center, I worked as a field coordinator for Camp Sea Lab, an outdoor science school in Seaside, teaching marine science to fifth to eighth graders during three to four-day field trips. I also did internships on the East Coast, working with different whale species, identifying them and conducting behavioral analysis. My passion for the ocean has driven my career, always seeking jobs related to marine science.",

If I was focusing on a cause that maybe I didn't feel so deeply passionate about, I can see that being really hard. And so I would say if there's someone that's coming into development, or considering this as a career that they should find something that they're passionate about, and try to go be the Development Director for that if it's homelessness, or if it's health services, Human Services, anything like that, but to try to go down that route and really find the passion.

I think it's impacted my life really positively working for the Seymour Center. So I've worked at the Seymour Center for about five years in the development director role for two years and three years before that, as the Volunteer or the Visitor Programs Manager. What I always say about the Seymour Center is I feel so fortunate to work there, I get to work somewhere that people want to volunteer. And that means something so every day when I get there, I see a group of volunteers that is giving up their time to come talk to the public about the ocean, and it's just really positive. It's a really positive environment. I work with some incredible coworkers, everyone who is passionate about their job. And so I think it's just given me a lot of career satisfaction being surrounded by either volunteers or coworkers that are just happy to be there. It means a lot to find an environment that you go to. You're at work a lot, you end up being at work a lot more than you're at home. It's great. I've just found this environment of really happy positive people and so I think it's just given me satisfaction.",

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 24:38 There's a quote that I'm going to try not to mess up. What is it? What is it? It's like people only conserve what they love. People only love what they learn and people only understand what they are taught I think is how it goes or something along those lines and I always think about that, as people, I think it's the really important part of why marine science education is so important, not just that the science is happening, but that we are here to connect people to the research and the science, because people aren't going to protect things that they don't care about, or that they don't understand or that they don't know about. If they don't know that there are these incredible deep-sea creatures, no one's gonna want to protect them, no one's gonna want to, you know, pass bills or create individual change to protect these things that they don't know exist. So I've always kind of, at least in the past couple years in the education part of my career, really focused on that quote, as something to kind of live by, like, people are only going to try to protect what they know about. And so that's my job is to teach them.",

And you can learn all about the upcoming volunteer opportunities, we have four different trainings a year. So there's always kind of a training coming up.

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 26:47 You should always take the opportunity to meet new people. So if you are just graduating, and you're trying to figure out how to get the next job or meet the right people, there are many listservs out there that you can sign up for and see that they're doing blue drinks, or there's a talk coming up. UC Santa Cruz has a lot of great events listed on their website. I would just go to those talks, go to those events and try to meet people and just ask them. The Seymour Center does a science Sunday lecture, the third Sunday of every month, where we bring a scientist to the Seymour Center to talk about their research and their career. And there's always this open question time. And so many times people, high school students, college students, at the end, walk up to these very famous scientists and say, How do I become you? And there's this great opportunity. And it's just because those students were there. So I would just say go, go to talks, go to lectures, send emails, take people out to coffee, just try to network and meet people.",

Wait, so just so I understand you, you do both, right? So how often, how much time do you spend in the cafe and outside also working for the company?  Rachel Rasmussen 3:05 Yeah, so I do both. Three days a week, I'm in the cafe and two days a week I am doing administrative work. The administrative work is really fun for me because I get to work at any of our cafes, or I could work at home. Sometimes I work at Verve to mix up my life a little bit. So I love that I'm not stuck in necessarily showing up at the same place at the same time every day. I have flexibility in my schedule. But yeah, being a barista is so much fun for me because I get to see so many people every day. And we as a staff create relationships with the guests that come in, know their names and their stories, and get to ask about trips they went on and the kind of like, Oh, your mom's coming in town for Thanksgiving. How was that? Was it okay? And just being able to get to know the people that come in.",

And that's just what you do. We laugh and have fun. We also have to move really quick on weekends and I end up covered in avocado and coffee. I leave work and I'm like, I smell like avocado toast and a latte and I'm like, Okay, time to shower. But the other days of the week that I'm working on admin stuff, it's a lot of meetings with my boss Tanner, who is in charge of the whole human resources department. We meet and right now I'm in quite a learning process of our payroll organization that we use. It's quite complex to work with a company that has 60-something employees, trying to figure out making sure everyone has the right sick policy and paid time off policy and holiday pay.

Rachel Rasmussen 8:01 I definitely think it's bringing me to my goals. I learn a lot about people every day and the things that make them tick. One of the things I talk a lot about in sociology and psychology is there's always more under the surface. If someone comes into the cafe and we don't have exactly what they're looking for, and they're upset with us, and they leave angry, most of the time, it has nothing to do with me as a person. That's something cool to think about. Going towards a career as a therapist probably won't necessarily be about me a lot. People are often scared of not being in control. As soon as something happens outside their realm, they might be upset. So that's something I'm learning, how to work with people. I meet hundreds of people every day and I'm learning a more expansive view of people.",

We're speaking with Rachel Rasmussen and learning about her career journey in becoming a barista and human resources concierge at Cat and Cloud Coffee. Are there any common misconceptions about being a barista or working in HR?  Danielle Davis 13:18 I feel like that question suits this interview super well, considering just your career path and everything. Could you elaborate on that?  Rachel Rasmussen 13:26 There are so many misconceptions. When I first told my grandmother I got a job at a coffee shop, she was like, Oh, you're gonna make coffee? I was so excited about it. Oftentimes in the coffee industry, baristas are not paid well or cared for well. I have a lot of friends who work in coffee who may not be cared for well. But stepping into a space like Cat and Cloud, where full-time employees get four weeks of paid time off a year, access to benefits, and profit sharing. A certain percentage of the coffee and merchandise sales goes back to the employees. There are three original owners and four employee owners. The decisions made by the company are made by the people working in it rather than any sort of investors. The biggest misconception about being a barista is I feel super cared for. I love what I do, and I feel valued as a person, not just for my work. Also, being able to work in the background of a growing company, not just on the floor making coffee, allows me to invest in the company. Back in September, our first cafe had its third birthday. We're a relatively young company.",

Charles had a background on Wall Street and worked with coffee farmers in Sudan. He came down with malaria and had to move home. After recovering, he started working at Verve in finances. They had a passion for coffee and a career in coffee. Chris and Jared believed you didn't need to own a coffee shop to have a career in coffee, which is funny now because they own one.

Feel free to ask your question now,   what is the most challenging part of your job?   Burr Guthrie  15:54   A great question. I talked to Jacob earlier. So when you become an administrator in a school or college, part of an administrator is you have to manage people, and you recruit teachers and recruit clerks. It's personally for me, it's hard to it's a skill I'm still working on. But imagine when you a good friend, giving critical feedback to people can be hard. Imagine telling your friends something that they don't want to hear. It's really an art of having a conversation with somebody, and you need to give them critical information, which is really just another word for I need, I need you to improve in some area. So it's a real skill to be critical of somebody without hurting their feelings. So there's a way to be critical where you're lifting somebody up. And so a skill I work on when you're working with a teacher who needs improvement, there's a way to talk to them where they will surface the problem so that I don't have to. For example, you you might say, Well, I was in your classroom, and I observed that maybe not all of the students were really engaged. And during that time, you were delivering a lesson on the past tense, and you can talk to somebody where they may say, you know, I forgot to do this or that, and so they're doing the work for you, and you're you're helping them to identify an area of improvement so that I don't have to say that, and to be really supportive and nurturing, it's a hard thing to be a boss, to have to reprimand somebody. It's really hard for me, other people, it may come naturally. I hope that answered your question.",

And during that time, you were delivering a lesson on the past tense, and you can talk to somebody where they may say, you know, I forgot to do this or that, and so they're doing the work for you, and you're you're helping them to identify an area of improvement so that I don't have to say that, and to be really supportive and nurturing, it's a hard thing to be a boss, to have to reprimand somebody. It's really hard for me, other people, it may come naturally. I hope that answered your question.",

It's personally for me, it's hard to it's a skill I'm still working on. But imagine when you a good friend, giving critical feedback to people can be hard. Imagine telling your friends something that they don't want to hear. It's really an art of having a conversation with somebody, and you need to give them critical information, which is really just another word for I need, I need you to improve in some area.

Another question we have here, relative What does a day at work look like and we'll, let's say we're in I say this all the time, a normal, uninhibited, non covid world, yeah,   Burr Guthrie  18:09   I miss those days. It seems so long ago, a normal day i i mentioned night school. We have a lot of night classes every four nights a week, usually, and there are three administrators here. So I spend at least two nights here for our night classes. We try to have an administrator wherever we have teachers and students, three days a week, I come to work at eight or 830 I check in with the office staff. Is everything going? Okay? All the photo copiers working. Everything's working. All the teachers checked in. I try to spend an hour or so walking through classrooms just saying, how's everybody doing today? I'm Burr. I'm the coordinator. I'm here to support your teacher. How are you so I like to connect with students. I'll make sure I address the teacher. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, my computer's broken. Can you help me with technology? And then I'll spend time in my office. It's important that we stay on top of communication. There's a lot of the emails I may be working on a grant, doing some budgeting. I may be working on teacher evaluation. We're always planning. We're talking to people who have ideas for a new class. Hey, how about a 3d printing class? Do you guys need a 3d printing teacher? So we're always engaging with new teachers and new ideas. We spend a little time going to conferences, mostly all local, sometimes Southern California. I spend a lot of time in meetings. A lot of people hate meetings. I have to go to a lot of meetings. What's really important now, I believe, is to. To spend time connected with the students and the teachers, to make sure you're so make sure you're meeting student need. Listening to students. We try to have a student council and give us space for students to to give us critical feedback, like, hey, the bathroom is really dirty, or the parking lot is not safe at night, or, you know this teacher is excellent, or that the computers in the lab are bad. Can you help us get new computers? It's important to me to stay connected with students to make sure we're meeting their need. So a typical day, this is not a boring job. I don't spend more than an hour in my office at a time. I like to walk around and connect with students. I go to meetings at Cabrillo College or at the County Office of Ed some of our high schools down here. It's really dynamic, and it's not boring. It's it's great.

We try to have an administrator wherever we have teachers and students, three days a week, I come to work at eight or 830 I check in with the office staff. Is everything going? Okay? All the photo copiers working. Everything's working. All the teachers checked in. I try to spend an hour or so walking through classrooms just saying, how's everybody doing today? I'm Burr. I'm the coordinator. I'm here to support your teacher. How are you so I like to connect with students. I'll make sure I address the teacher. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, my computer's broken. Can you help me with technology? And then I'll spend time in my office. It's important that we stay on top of communication. There's a lot of the emails I may be working on a grant, doing some budgeting. I may be working on teacher evaluation. We're always planning. We're talking to people who have ideas for a new class. Hey, how about a 3d printing class? Do you guys need a 3d printing teacher? So we're always engaging with new teachers and new ideas. We spend a little time going to conferences, mostly all local, sometimes Southern California. I spend a lot of time in meetings. A lot of people hate meetings. I have to go to a lot of meetings. What's really important now, I believe, is to. To spend time connected with the students and the teachers, to make sure you're so make sure you're meeting student need. Listening to students. We try to have a student council and give us space for students to to give us critical feedback, like, hey, the bathroom is really dirty, or the parking lot is not safe at night, or, you know this teacher is excellent, or that the computers in the lab are bad. Can you help us get new computers? It's important to me to stay connected with students to make sure we're meeting their need. So a typical day, this is not a boring job. I don't spend more than an hour in my office at a time. I like to walk around and connect with students. I go to meetings at Cabrillo College or at the County Office of Ed some of our high schools down here. It's really dynamic, and it's not boring. It's it's great. I recommend it if you're interested in education, I'll invite any of you to connect with me. Beyond here, I can give you my contact information. It's a really rewarding career education, whether you're teaching or supporting teachers.",

Get your credential in that area. Try to discover what age group you want to work with, I would say, get some experience teaching before you jump into administration, it's really important you understand what teachers go through, what their life is like, because as an educational administrator, you have to support teachers.

I I, like many people, I my parents didn't kick me out of the house, but when I finished high school, you know, they encouraged me to go to college. That senior year, I had applied to a few and I wasn't the strongest student in high school, and I wasn't sure, but I went to college and I moved away from town, and I think I might have been better served to take a year off before I went into college. And I didn't do great in college until my last year, and then I was really focused. So college is expensive, so you got to be ready for it. And it's a it's a really broad question, but I tried my hand in a few different things. You know, I tried to be a business guy, and I think I succeeded, but it wasn't fulfilling in my heart. So I tried a few different things in business, and I had some fun, got some good experience, and then I found teaching, and I fell in love with that. So I would say, try to get some different experiences and talk to people who you feel like you can talk to",

I think I'm going to be, I'm going to go into the farming industry when I get older.  Jessica: Not at all. I grew up in suburbia, right outside of New York City. My experience of gardening was, gardening with my grandfather. He liked to grow roses, but it was a very different type of gardening. Lots of Roundup and chemicals and all kinds of treatments, on those roses, but it did give me a love for being outdoors and tending to plants. And I didn't land on this career track, even as an undergrad, I studied anthropology, but after that, I spent a year working really hard, five different jobs and saving all the money I could so that I could travel.",

Can you tell us what that graduate experience was like?  Jessica: So, I kind of explored a lot of options for when I was in the phase of applying to graduate programs. I was interested in kind of a more of a science track for graduate school. Most environmental studies type programs are a science program. But I had a social science back. I really had to figure out where programs that would kind of accept what I had done as an undergrad and then still let me be in an environmental studies program. Luckily got in touch with a friend from undergrad who was from Vermont and had just started a master's program at the University of Vermont. He had done a biology undergrad and so he was well set to go into environmental science. But that program also was starting a new track to study environmental thought and culture. So yeah, so the environmental thought and culture was perfect. It was a bunch of anthropologists and sociologists who were interested in environmental science. So I ended up applying to that program because it was that culmination of both my background and where I was headed. And then because the program was so new, I got really lucky and was able to just kind of create the program I wanted. They were still building it. So as I figured out what I wanted to study and who would need to support me, what kind of experts I would need to learn from, I kind of built my track for my master's degree.",

I was lucky enough to be moving here with my husband who had a teaching job. We had some income and so I had some time to figure out what my career would be. And I have in the past had to piece together lots of part-time jobs to make one full-time job or one 60-hour week or whatever. So, I just jumped in doing that. I worked on a farm and then I worked with a permaculture landscaper that I had worked with the summer before. I just started doing what I could to meet people and figure out how to become a sustainable ag educator. Luckily one of my mentors, Ernesto Mendez, had come to the University of Vermont. I was on his hiring committee from the University of Santa Cruz. So he had a bunch of people to introduce me to, and I quickly met people at LifeLab and the CASFES program and other farming and education and outdoor ed organizations kind of right away. And then the connection to Live Earth Farm just happened through the farmer I was working with. She said, 'Hey, I've never heard of Live Earth Farm. You should call them and see what's happening over there.' And so I did. And it happened that they were trying to start an education program.",

Cause it sounds like an incredible task.  Jessica: The Montessori curriculum I did not do on my own. I had a couple teachers also working on it with me. The field trips, I had done a garden education. I had started a garden and garden education program for my master's project. So I did start with a year-long curriculum that I had written for that. And then there's also tons of great resources out there. So I didn't recreate the wheel. I used a lot of garden activities that were already being done in other places and adapted them to work in our scenario. We also have goats and chickens on the farm and so I did have to kind of come up with lessons to integrate the animals. A lot of that was developed for like school gardens and so it did take some adapting to change it to fit in a production farm. And that was always the biggest resource that we had at Farm Discovery, unlike other garden education programs, is it's on a production farm. We have a year-round CSA, and we do farmer's markets, and we have a crew of about 30 people growing food for this community year-round. So we really also try to tie in the making connections between the people working on the farm, growing the food, and the students\u2019 experience of farming. Yes, I learned a lot about writing curriculum in school, and then I learned a lot more applying it over time. And we definitely didn't build everything at once. We're 12 years old now. So, it's been a 12-year process of building curriculum.",

One of our largest clients is the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. So they of course, are not doing as much projects. Good Guys, a hot rod and custom show, is also another client of ours and they cut back severely this year. We have done a lot of COVID messaging for clients, because our largest client is Satellite Health Care, and they're a dialysis company. So helping the those health care workers understand, keeping them motivated, keeping them trained on how to keep themselves safe, how to educate their patients on how to stay safe. Our work overall, the amount of work actually hasn't changed because we've replaced what paid business that we've lost with a lot of pro bono work with nonprofits and small businesses here, especially in Scotts Valley.",

Susan O'Connor Fraser  24:31   I think that, like I said before, I think passion is important that you need to love this, because it'll show up in your work. It will show up in how you deal with the people that your clients how who you're dealing with if you love what you do. And we are also a very open and transparent company so clients know exactly what they're paying for from the very start. Finally, it can be very financially rewarding. So the money that people can make, well into the six figures, in if they go to work for a company, I think that the last time I looked at what a creative director makes, it was around $250,000. So you can do what you love, you can work for someone else, if you don't want to be your own boss and take that risk, you can make money at it. And I think what's really important to this generation of students is, you can do something meaningful in the world, that you're not just doing it for the money. You can do something that can in some ways, it can change the world. So that's my advice. Information I'd like to pass on is that it can be an extremely rewarding career.",

Susan O'Connor Fraser  20:08   I would say that to, you know, invest their time in learning and practicing the part of the craft that they are passionate about. Make sure that they are passionate about it, because that does require passion. The tools are so inexpensive these days that you can, our first edit suite was three quarters of a million dollars. And now you can edit on your iPhone, actually, or on a small laptop. But to practice and find where where you want to land, if you're going to go and try to start your own business, is to focus your education on business type courses, you can learn some of these tools in online tutorials. You don't necessarily have to take an After Effects class, not saying college isn't important, but it's focusing your attention in college on things that will help you in life and help you in your business. Or if you're going to go to work for someone else help you understand the ways that what you do can help your employer--going to get communications classes, for example, or marketing classes, I think are all you know, great options.   Our son wanted to go into our business and we said, Well, that's fine, but you're gonna go to college, and we're going to pay for it and you're going to learn something else. So what is that going to be. He went into Decision Information Sciences, which is the marriage of technology and marketing. And now he's a web developer making a lot of money living in Ohio and Ohio cost of living and making Silicon Valley salaries from his business that he owns. So I think he's glad that our advice was to not go to film school because he could, he could learn that in the family business. And he did. The Dalai Lama came into town into Santa Clara University, which is where my son went to school, and Tam and I were going to be up in Vancouver for another client and Santa Clara University wanted us to capture the event and to then edit some videos for them. So Tim, our son, headed one crew and Reagan, our daughter headed the other and they captured that event. They were both the field producers of those two teams. That's another very rewarding project in mind even though I was not on set or on production for that creating the videos from the interviews that we that they captured and putting it together and reading the transcripts from all the different speakers that talked about compassion in Silicon Valley was just kind of was a turning point for me and my life as well.",

Susan O'Connor Fraser  17:09   Well, I think having a thriving economy is important to our society. And so, all the stuff that we do for business communication, helping people, especially within the Bay Area, sell their products or keep their employees motivated, or train them to be better at their job. All of that is good for that reason. And as far as the business world goes, the stuff that we do with nonprofits, helps our community whether it's for the Community Foundation, we're also working right now with Second Harvest Food Bank to help get to help them with get the word out of the stuff they're doing. And we've worked with, we finished up some videos for the San Benito County Food Bank, and did some PSAs for all three, TriCounty Food Banks. So that's all good. And we've had nonprofit work that's been good part of our portfolio. Not always pro bono, but all of that stuff helps our community. And I think finally, the stuff that we do in more of the entertainment area or documentary is helping to have a more well informed community by informing viewers about different things or making them laugh. I mean, last year, or no it wasn't last year, it was maybe seven years ago now. We produced a two episode pilot, that was a reality show about life on the farm. And it aired on National Geographic television.   And, you know, anything that we do in the area of humor is making people laugh. I mean, we need that more than anything right now. Some of the other stuff that we've done over the years just has... I mean, we use humor a lot, whenever we can, and then more recently, we've been doing stuff that's COVID related. Even before COVID, we did a music video called Hands Clean and based on the song Hand Clap, we can make your hand clap and we changed the lyrics to be you can wash your hands clean. This year we did another music video for the same client, Satellite Healthcare, on mask wearing and instead of Raise your Glass by P!nk it was wear your mask. And so those are really fun and I think all those safety messages are important. We worked with the Santa Cruz County Economic Recovery Council on two different videos. One that just got released last week, which is an animated piece on employee safety for workers throughout the county. You know, and especially those that are working in restaurants and stores and how to keep safe and how to keep our community healthy, safe, and open, which hopefully we will be open again you know in the coming month or two.",

And so, all the stuff that we do for business communication, helping people, especially within the Bay Area, sell their products or keep their employees motivated, or train them to be better at their job. All of that is good for that reason. And as far as the business world goes, the stuff that we do with nonprofits, helps our community whether it's for the Community Foundation, we're also working right now with Second Harvest Food Bank to help get to help them with get the word out of the stuff they're doing. And we've worked with, we finished up some videos for the San Benito County Food Bank, and did some PSAs for all three, TriCounty Food Banks. So that's all good. And we've had nonprofit work that's been good part of our portfolio. Not always pro bono, but all of that stuff helps our community. And I think finally, the stuff that we do in more of the entertainment area or documentary is helping to have a more well informed community by informing viewers about different things or making them laugh. I mean, last year, or no it wasn't last year, it was maybe seven years ago now. We produced a two episode pilot, that was a reality show about life on the farm. And it aired on National Geographic television.   And, you know, anything that we do in the area of humor is making people laugh. I mean, we need that more than anything right now. Some of the other stuff that we've done over the years just has... I mean, we use humor a lot, whenever we can, and then more recently, we've been doing stuff that's COVID related. Even before COVID, we did a music video called Hands Clean and based on the song Hand Clap, we can make your hand clap and we changed the lyrics to be you can wash your hands clean. This year we did another music video for the same client, Satellite Healthcare, on mask wearing and instead of Raise your Glass by P!nk it was wear your mask. And so those are really fun and I think all those safety messages are important. We worked with the Santa Cruz County Economic Recovery Council on two different videos. One that just got released last week, which is an animated piece on employee safety for workers throughout the county. You know, and especially those that are working in restaurants and stores and how to keep safe and how to keep our community healthy, safe, and open, which hopefully we will be open again you know in the coming month or two.",

And you know, most importantly, I think, from the human perspective, we have this incredible playground, we can surf in it, we can kayak in it, we can scuba dive in it, we can do all kinds of things.

As a marine biologist, you know, I did deep sea research, I was fortunate enough to work with remotely operated vehicles at Ambari Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute for my graduate work. And through that experience of doing science, and actually publishing that science in journals, I learn that the science language is not always readily available to the public.

So I do education and outreach of science at Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Another aspect of my job that is really, really exciting for me is something we call ecosystem based management. It's like what I was telling you about, that we, as humans, often separate ourselves from those other animals out there, while we are part of that ecosystem.

Lisa Uttal  13:46   I was, you know, I followed my passion. And I was fortunate enough. When I was a freshman at University of Michigan, I had an opportunity I went to Hawaii for the summer to and I learned to scuba dive in the warm water. So Hawaii, and then I also ended up volunteering as to train dolphins in a research project. And this was when they were scientists were just finding out that dolphins actually had you know, language, they could recognize hand signals. And they would use that in combination with sonar sounds, and they would literally train the dolphins to do seven word sentences. Wow. Oh, it might be something like tap your tail, swim, jump over get the ball. You know, wouldn't be that complex, but it would be like ball tap tail. So behaviors. We were teaching dolphins how to do behaviors. And I went back to Michigan, and I had just had a passion. I just knew that I wanted to study the ocean. And so I had a lot of people Tell me, hey, especially in Michigan, what jobs are there? There's no jobs and marine science. And I kind of ignored a lot of that. What I did was I, every opportunity I got, I would go and volunteer for an organization. So Noah has internships throughout the year with different NOAA institutions that you can volunteer for. I",

Lisa Uttal  13:46   I was, you know, I followed my passion. And I was fortunate enough. When I was a freshman at University of Michigan, I had an opportunity I went to Hawaii for the summer to and I learned to scuba dive in the warm water. So Hawaii, and then I also ended up volunteering as to train dolphins in a research project.

Well,   Lisa Uttal  18:42   there's something I always tell people while I may have started out as what I call a whale hugger, I wanted to study dolphins and whales, initially there the marine science or marine biology, or you want to see say any of this, the careers are so diverse now, you could be come in engineer, a marine engineer, you could be building the remotely operated vehicles or the autonomous underwater vehicles, you could be that engineer who builds those tools for the scientists to use. You could be a communicator, like I am about science. I love interacting with people. I love educating people about the really heavy science nerdy stuff in the ocean. You could also there's different facets of marine biology. And it's not just marine biology, you could become an oceanographer and study physical oceanography or chemical oceanography or physics, or geological oceanography. So if you like rocks and underwater volcanoes, you can be studying that. I think it's just being really creative. First, following your passion. Second, be really creative about how you use your In education, to an end, then what you like to do, for example, I use a ton of art in my outreach.

I've developed programs that have an ecosystem based approach. And I've worked with fishermen and developed curriculum that is about fisheries and fishermen and fishing communities. That's one of my favorites. More recently, I just mentioned that I helping at Cabrillo College to co teach a course where we have students that monitor over time throughout the semester. What are plankton populations are from three different locations here in Santa Cruz. And they go and they collect and they are actually paralleling research that's going on at UC Santa Cruz and with the state of California on vital plankton. So their information goes into a NOAA database. And that database is capturing over time and at different locations so we can monitor what's going on in the sanctuary. That's",

And also having my internship at KSQD and meeting just the great people there, learning about the great programs there, and just being able to help make some radio features and getting out in the community and doing some infield reporting during the fires and during the elections was a lot of fun. And so yeah, thank you for that opportunity. I really appreciate it. Would you mind telling us about how you got into journalism, and maybe just some of your background?  Rachel Anne Goodman  2:41   Yeah, it's a long circuitous path that I've taken in my career, this is probably the heading ought to be you know, how to have a really unconventional career path, how to make it yourself, make your life what you want it to be. I actually went through college, you know, in a straight path, I thought, thought I was going to be a psychology major switch to environmental studies pretty quickly after I got to UC Santa Cruz back in the early 80s. And as I was studying natural history, thinking I was going to be a park ranger. I stumbled into KZSC my second year, and was so inspired by the student producers I met there who taught me what they knew, you know, they threw me out into reporting almost, you know, without any experience, this is hands on learning. I had to kind of backtrack later and learn, you know, about journalism from more of an academic perspective. But at first, I was sent to cover, you know, the city council races in Santa Cruz, not knowing anything about them, except go find some candidates and interview them.  And of course, I mispronounced Marti Wormhoudt's name. And I think I said worm hood. And she corrected me quickly. very embarrassed. So that was my introduction to radio reporting. See to the pants just go get the story. And that was fun. You know, I kind of got the bug at that point. I also am a Music Fanatic and strolling through their miles of vinyl records was my music education along with my own exploration, playing music, I listened to so much there that I got very interested in very non mainstream music like traditional old time music and folk and things like that there. So it's a wonderful resource for anybody who goes to UC Santa Cruz to take advantage of that wonderful learning opportunity hands on at the radio station or the wonderful newspaper. They have their city on a hill press. So that's kind of the beginning, you know, of where I got the bug. And I also learned fundraising, which was an invaluable tool that later helped me become an independent radio producer, which is a thing it's like an independent film producer. you fund your own projects through grants, and you go out and produce them. So when I moved to East Kentucky, to a little town called Whitesburg, I worked for a media company.   Rachel Anne Goodman  5:07   My first job was with Apple shop. And Apple shop is an independent media company that produces videos, music from Appalachia, all with a lens to celebrate the culture of that region. I was their fundraiser, helping fund everything from films to videos to theater productions. But as I started to write these grants, I thought, I want to be on the production side. This looks like more fun than what I'm doing. So I wrote a grant to the National Endowment for the Arts for a 13 part documentary series about women in early country, an old time music. I called it Southern Songbirds. And Patrick, you know, this is the imposter syndrome at work here. I really didn't know how to produce a documentary, when I wrote that grant. I went out to California, and enrolled in a documentary course, so that I could do what I had promised to do. And I found some of the best teachers at Western Public Radio, Leo Lee, Catherine Stifter, Michael Johnson, were my mentors there. And they continue to help me as I produced that series, and we're talking 13 half hours, each one focused on a different person, lots of archival music, archival interviews, as well as in person interviews. So I was driving up these hollers, you know, in these old dirt roads in the rain, trying to find these women through their directions, you know, and sitting with them in their living rooms, hearing their life stories. And that was probably one of the best things I've ever done. Even now, looking back, it taught me so much about a life well lived.   Rachel Anne Goodman  6:44   And I have to tip my hat to my mom here. My mother, Judith was a similarly curious person about other people's lives and wrote a book called Big Sur women, I think both of us are feminists at heart, she carved her own life out of the Big Sur wilderness and lived on her own terms. She loved nature, but she also wrote about people's lives and lose the kind of amateur historian. And so I was inspired by her to do my project. And when it came out, it got in stations, all over the world. Got into Ireland and got into some countries in Africa, I would get letters from all over the world. And that really helped me understand the power of this medium for telling stories. And it was just so much fun to produce. And and you'll have to realize that during the time I made that radio production was done on quarter inch reel to reel tape. It was first done on a cassette transfer to quarter inch, you literally sliced and diced it with an editing tool called the razor blade and a little block where you cut the tape and then you've got taped from elsewhere in the interview, and you taped it with editing tape back into its spot. So at one point, I had all these clotheslines in the studio with different pieces of audio hanging on the clothesline with a label, this goes here and that goes there. And I would reorganize it and you could slice out a word. But if you sliced it wrong, you had to start all over because you would have ruined the word wasn't like digital anything. So it took a long time and eventually ended up with this mixdowns you know, from quarter inch to half inch back quarter inch, you would mail it to NPR to put up on the satellite system so that other stations could take it down and run it. So the technology has changed vastly in my time. And thank goodness, I am not nostalgic for cutting tape, even though there's something manual and satisfying when you get it right.",

Rachel Anne Goodman  8:51   I kept producing documentaries, really different ones that took me to different places. After that one, I produced one called changing habits about a order of nuns that was working in Appalachia that had to give up their vows to the church and make their own organization because they were constricted from being with the people and helping them. And that was a really exciting project to help them write a book. And after that, I made a documentary for a program called horizons, which was a documentary series on NPR, about midwives in the south, who used to like ride horseback up the hollers to deliver babies. So that was really exciting. And they were called granny women. So I interviewed a bunch of these women. And of course, I was pregnant while I was interviewing them. So I was getting all kinds of good advice.",

But he's just a lot of fun to talk to. And I think he he was at logos for like 30 years or something and just involved in music, and he gets to do what he loves. And okay, KSQD seems to be full of people like that.  Rachel Anne Goodman  26:28   It is there such a wealth to talk to. So I highly recommend getting to know, these people who are really the heart of the station that. We have 120 some odd volunteers, and they come in for the love of radio, they don't get paid. They're doing this because they love it. And they want to share it with the community. You know, community radio is really different than public radio, which is mostly piped in from Washington, DC, which is all very fine and good. But you won't hear about your neighbors recovering from a fire, you know, and who's got soup to donate, you won't hear that kind of really local, helping hands type of radio, on those other stations, we were kind of different that way. And I'm proud of that fact that, you know, this is these are your people, your tribe, all communicating together. And during COVID, that's become even more essential that we have a place to go to find out what's going on and how to get through this together. So we're not so isolated in our individual homes.,",

I graduated the culinary program at Cabrillo back in the early 2000s. So about 20 years ago, I was becoming a chef in the program myself and went off and did my thing as a caterer. I have had a catering business for 16 years now. Started teaching slowly here and there. And then now I would say that teaching is my primary job rather than my catering.",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  2:33   Congratulations on that. And I think it's great that they have you as an instructor as a grad of the program. Do you mind telling our listeners more about the program?  Andrea Mollenauer  2:41   Oh sure. So the culinary arts program that Cabrillo offers everything from foundational culinary instruction in the form of its beginning courses, both lecture based and lab based all the way up to advanced kind of restaurant style service. And, you know, there's also there's also a baking department, there's also a wine section. And so you can get a variety of different certificates and associate's degrees. And there's what I like about it myself compared to other programs in the region is, I love that it has a hands on opportunities for the students because we also run labs that actually provide food to the public. So a little bit different during the pandemic situation right now. But typically, we have a beginning lunch restaurant and an advanced dinner restaurant and a full catering program that caters parties and events. You know a lot of weddings, at the historic Sesnon house on campus at Cabrillo. And right now we still are operating some select courses on campus with kind of like a rigorous protocol for safety. But we were still doing some on campus courses. And so we're doing takeout for people to come and pick up our food instead of the restaurant since the restaurant at this time is not considered safe.",

And you talked about that the grads of the program get certificates and with those certificates, does that put the students or the grads in a good position to land jobs in the kitchen out there.  Andrea Mollenauer  6:13   I like to think so. A degree in anything doesn't guarantee you a job. However, in a really competitive industry like food and culinary where people can climb that ladder within a restaurant from busser or dishwasher all the way up to prep cook and sous chef, I would say that a degree from a program like Cabrillo could, for example, give them a little bit of a leg up a little bit. Perhaps if more practice technique, I think it's also going to depend heavily on the student and the students commitment to a really hard industry like culinary arts. And if it's right for them, I think a degree is a really great way to kind of jumpstart that pathway for them, it's often going to be that people need to start low in an organization like a restaurant and build their way up and show what you know, show what they know and practice technique based on what that restaurant specializes in. But it's really creating a foundation for them with the certificate or the degree you know, the all of the foundational work that we practice in the program is kind of like the building blocks for them, in my opinion.",

And I would imagine that your duties and responsibilities have changed, maybe somewhat and, and I know some of this, we were talking about before the interview that you're making some like construction videos that will just serve as like foundation material for your class going forward, which I think is great.   Andrea Mollenauer  12:14   Yeah all my classes actually and teaching in the high school setting as well. And the high school culinary program that I teach is all online, none of it has come back to in person education. And so a lot of the slide decks and the instructional videos and all of the photo documents that I'm putting together for the students I feel like are going to be really great resources that I can use in the future, even if we do come back in person, and they can refer to them at home and they're practicing their knife skills at home or, you know, I can use them to send out as pre learning materials. So they can be like a little bit up on the material before coming into class and practicing the techniques. So I'm just loving putting together all of the new educational material. It's a lot of work. Like I'm not gonna lie, I think you said it earlier. It's a stress on teachers as well, that is unprecedented. But I'm actually really loving the results. Like the results are that I'm coming up with tons of other ways of teaching what I've been teaching for many, many years, and I'm coming up with a ton of foundational material in a ways that I never would have had time or made the time to do before. And so I think that when all this is said and done, it sounds crazy, but it's going to make me a better teacher. And so there is a small nugget of positivity here.",

When I was just graduating the program, one of my instructors, one of my instructors and mentors said, Hey, there's this, there's this private high school in Santa Cruz County that is looking for a summer culinary instructor. And I think you'd fit the you know, the bill. And so I started teaching. And over the years, my teaching ability developed into kind of growing an entire high school culinary program for the County Office of Education. And that culinary program is offered to all of the County high school students, they have to register with their career and technical education counselor on campus. And then my particular program, this isn't the same in all communities, but my particular program, they come to me so I own a kitchen. And the students would come after school, they'd come off campus to my kitchen, and they would work in a professional kitchen environment. And so that culinary arts program was kind of a starting way to kind of explore if they liked food enough to make a career out of it. And you know, some of the students and actually many of the students that took my high school classes were not there for career purposes, or they realized really quickly like, well, this is not for me, but they left with this really great foundation of how to feed themselves and how to cook for themselves.

But if you cook liver correctly, and you saute some onions, and you throw that on there too, and you don't overcook it, it's actually quite delicious and very healthy. So I mean, part of that culinary education, I like to say, is just being super adventurous. And I tell my students like my rule is you got to taste everything twice, because the first time maybe it just wasn't done properly. Maybe the person you had it by just didn't understand the cooking process. And if you try it again, you might be surprised.",

But do you want to just kind of briefly tell us kind of what your typical day or week looks like?  Erin: 8:51   Sure. So a lot of my time goes into planning and creating content for the volunteers, we have a really unique program, and that we spend a lot of time and effort in making sure that the volunteers know what\u2019s going on at the aquarium, they get at least an hour of enrichment time before they head out into the aquarium to talk with guests. And there aren\u2019t a lot of places that are able to do that. But from the very beginning of this program, we have made sure to keep education in a really high on our priority list. And so, again, a lot of my time goes into making sure that we keep that going that we have something new and exciting to share with the volunteers and that we keep them up to date with what\u2019s going on. And that includes interpretive techniques, and how to talk with guests. And one of the kind of more recent things that we have done actually wasn\u2019t a terribly recent shift, but maybe about 10 or 15 years ago, we switched over to making sure that all of our volunteers have some climate communication techniques under their belt and so that they can have those conversations about climate change, and how that affects our oceans and how changes in our ocean affect all of us on land no matter where we are. So that\u2019s been something that\u2019s been really important. And we try to work that in to a lot of our content. And then the another part of my day, a huge part of my day is just meeting with and teaching the volunteers themselves. You know, we again, that is a such an important part of what we do here in our volunteer program. And so being face to face with the volunteers and telling them about the things they need to know for the day giving them these absolutely incredible enrichments that the team comes up with is just really huge. And a really a really important part of my job for me, as well as is having that FaceTime with the volunteers. And then I also get to be out in the aquarium interpreting to guests, talking with the volunteers, making sure that everything is going well for them while they are interpreting to guests as well. So supporting them out in the aquarium and getting to do what I love to and interpreting the exhibits.  Okay, and did I hear that? They\u2019re allowing people in kind of, do you do schedule a time to come to the aquarium? Is that how it looks right now?   Erin: 4:20   Correct? Yeah, we do have time ticketing. But once you\u2019re inside, you can spend as much time as you want in there. So, we don\u2019t limit the time that someone spends inside. We just need to know what time you\u2019re coming.",

I know you said in the beginning of your education, you thought you were going to be maybe doing more like research in the lab, but you\u2019re kind of doing, you know, something quite a bit different than that now,  Erin: 12:55   yeah, it absolutely is different. So when I first started as a volunteer and was just starting to get into the world of interpretation, I was able to benefit from the awesome systems that we have in place for teaching the volunteers. We have some incredible interpreters on staff that have been in the field for many, many years. And they have put together some really cool courses and material to help our volunteers learn. And so that was kind of where I got started with the field of interpretation. And then once I joined as stuff and started working more with the volunteers, I was able to start going to conferences and taking classes and courses on some of it was online, some of it was in person, getting certifications for interpretation. The network for interpreters around the world, and especially here in the United States is absolutely incredible. And there are interpreters at all sorts of different places. Even park rangers national park rangers are technically interpreters there. There are interpreters almost anywhere that you go, each one of those places, what interpretation looks like at each one of those places looks a little bit different. But we all kind of have the same goal at heart is to share the things that we love that we\u2019re passionate about and to create those meaningful connections. So there are some incredible resources through the National Association for interpretation and a few other organizations that can really help someone who is interested in interpretation to build their skills to maybe take that interest in a particular direction. Maybe you like talking about climate change and you want to have some of those meaningful connections and conversations about our climate we\u2019ve got or the National Association for interpretation that has some courses to help develop that there is no GI and oh CCI, the National Network for ocean and climate change interpretation that has some wonderful resources to that can be a really great place to get started, a lot of their resources are afraid. And so there are so many different ways to start building skills in interpretation. And even if you don\u2019t necessarily go into interpretation, they are skills that can benefit almost everybody in a lot of different ways.",

Well, here\u2019s another moment that was kind of kind of early on in my career. And it was one that that I think about quite often, I was out on the back deck of the aquarium, and it was just a lovely fall day. And I\u2019m a pretty avid birder. And so I was watching all the birds. And this was before I was a decent birder. So I didn\u2019t really know a lot about what I was, was looking at, but I saw an unusual thing going on with the birds, or there was a bird that was chasing some other birds and stealing the food that they had just caught. And I\u2019m going, Wow, what the heck is this? This is so cool. I have no idea what I\u2019m looking at. And I just happened to find another burger. And I was describing the situation to him. And he said, Oh, well, that was probably a parasitic Jaeger that was stealing the food from other birds. And he said it just so nonchalantly. And I thought, Okay, well, that must be a pretty common thing. But I didn\u2019t really know enough about the birds in the area yet to know if that was common or not. And so I passed it along to someone else, who was actually my, my mentor at the time here on staff. And he just, he got so excited. And it turned out to be a pretty rare sighting from from the deputy aquarium. And that really kind of got me started on my birding journey, but also on just being able to share the stories about things that are happening right outside our door. And one of the things that my mentor said to me, pretty soon after that, while we were talking about this experience was that you don\u2019t have to go to new places to see new things. You just have to learn to look with new eyes. And that has really, really stuck with me and I think about that all the time. And that\u2019s something just a mindset that I try to keep with me. And later on here. I think it was that same day. But just after hearing that, I encountered someone else who was a birder who was a guest at the aquarium, and he was someone visiting from the East Coast, and so hadn\u2019t really seen a whole lot of our California birds. So he was looking for just any bird that we could see from the aquarium. And so with this, this kind of new mindset that I had, we were I was able to pick out three new life birds for him. And he had been birding for many, many years. But just right there, on the deck of the aquarium, we picked out three new birds that he had never seen before in his life. And they were birds that were very typical for us around here. And had I not had that kind of mindset shift. I might never have pointed out these birds to this person, he was just so excited to have these new birds that he had never seen before. And that really helped to cement that that mindset for me.",

And, Erin, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career as something that you do as an interpreter or a volunteer supervisor at a place like the Monterey Bay Aquarium,  Erin: 26:50   both of those career paths, which in my case, just happen to intersect, but for either going into the field of interpretation, becoming a volunteer supervisor, or working with volunteers, one of the most important things to do is is to volunteer, if you want to go into interpretation is a really great way to figure out what kind of interpretation you want to do, what kinds of facilities or historical sites or whatever that you that you might want to be at, it\u2019s a really great way to gain that experience. And if you want to work with volunteers, being a volunteer, I think is an absolutely vital perspective that you need to have in order to work with volunteers. So you know, find a place that you love and see if you can become a volunteer there and see what it\u2019s like.",

If you\u2019re at a historic site, that\u2019s going to look very different from interpreting at an aquarium, for example. So kind of take a look at different places. And in my experience, the best thing that I ever did was to try something new that I didn\u2019t even know that I would want to do it was just a completely new experience for me.

If you\u2019re at a historic site, that\u2019s going to look very different from interpreting at an aquarium, for example. So kind of take a look at different places.

And I started as being a Czech writer, basically a translator for my parents writing all of the stuff that they needed. And while I was growing up, my dad was finding different ways. He's an entrepreneur, just like my mom. And so they came already with that kind of entrepreneurial mindset. And they did all different kinds of things. They started different businesses, and were really successful, especially when you think about the fact that they didn't speak English. And, totally had a different coming from the former Yugoslavia, very different culture, communism.",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  3:57   Yeah, it was really, really cool.  Nada Miljkovic  3:58    Yeah, it's two villages, one heart. The documentary is basically out of this feeling that I have.  Let's say Allah, Margaret, Mead, that all the villages in the world are similar. So I ended up making a hour long documentary with some help from Sun. Sun up in Boulder Creek and a whole bunch of other people, it was a total community project. And with that, two villagers went hard about how Ben Lomond is very similar to my ancestral village in Serbia. Basically, it came down to a lot of Neo paganism and stewardship for nature exaltation. I ended up getting into the digital arts and new media program at UCSC. After that, when I graduated in 2009, I started a series of different small businesses: media, studio type businesses. The one that stuck was Artists on Art, which I'm still doing as a videographer. I also started teaching up at UCSC. I got this really amazing opportunity to teach radio and broadcast media. With that, I ended up meeting my champion, who is the provost of Crown College. The first time I met him he said Hey Nada. I told him I wanted to teach full time. And he said, Well, what would you like to teach? If you could do anything? What would you teach? And I said, I'd want to teach entrepreneurship, I feel like more than half of those students or at least half the students are going to end up working as freelancers and gig artists. We're not really training them for that. I mean, UCSC is an amazing school. It's an incredible research school. But as far as students knowing how to make invoices, proposals, and executing, I mean, they all know how to execute. It's the administrative part of of having a business, a small business. And he said, That's exactly what I want to do!   And so with that, in 2016, we had our first entrepreneurship class, Crown 90. It's a startup academy.  A lot of students come with a business that they want to do. But that's not a requirement, you can join other people's teams. They learn how to do what we call the Lean Startup method, which is a method that came out of Stanford, with Steve Blank, who lives up in Pescadero. Where you do customer discovery, you find out if you have a market before you do anything. That's why it's the lean startup. So, we started Crown 90 and then we started thinking about social entrepreneurship, businesses for good, nonprofits. So then we created Crown 92. And then my latest class is Crown 95, which is called Get Virtual.  This class was begun as a direct response to COVID with Toby Quarry. Toby is a local entrepreneur. I think he's the CEO or I'm not sure exactly, but he was working at cruise foam. He's an exec over at Cruise Foam where they're creating a natural based type styrofoam for packing. We have a terrible plastic problem as probably most of you know. And so, Cruise Foam is a Santa Cruz company started by Marco Rolandi, who is a electrical engineering professor up at UCSC.  They use some type of calcium, I think it's from  sea creatures. They're creating this foam that is disposable.   So Toby calls me up and he says, Hey Nada, I got this idea. There's all these businesses, the small businesses here in town, that are going to wither because of the social distancing protocols that were put in place for COVID. And he says, I got this idea, these college students have these incredible digital skills. They're born into the digital world, very different from you and I and older folk. And so they have the skills that they could help these business owners to help them get online because as you know, a lot of the businesses here in town rely on tourism and people just walking into the stores. And many of these stores have been around for more than 30 years. And they've never had a website, they've never had a social media campaign. That's just not been a part of their needs, because they have walk in foot traffic into their brick and mortar stores. But with social distancing, that was put to a halt. And so, along with Bonnie Lipscomb from the City of Santa Cruz Economic Development, she gave us a couple businesses that she thought we could help. I grabbed my best entrepreneurship students and we together prototyped this class Crown 95, which we've been teaching every quarter since March of 2020. It's now become a part of UC wide. Anybody in the UC can take the class across campuses.   We're also a part of the California Open College Program. So any student in a community college across California can take the class as well for free. People from Cabrillo college can take the class for free because we're in this program. And in this class, we basically teach the students about how to do interviewing, intake interviewing, write a proposal, get that proposal approved by their clients. The proposal has timelines, milestones.  Most of the work is either very low or no code, website building,  marketing campaigns, digital media, social media platforms, and that. We also make sure that our clients are able to use the websites after it.  Because we're using these low or no code, website platforms, it's very easy for my students to both pick it up themselves, and then teach somebody else how to do it. And so since then, we've launched over 100 clients, where we've completed their work. We've had over 150 students and volunteers working with us. We still have a large portion of the first students now become executives of Get virtual, they're co-founders of Get Virtual. And we have six other universities across the country that are using Get Virtual curriculum and program in their universities.",

You do so much and you haven't really covered all of it. Can you just like briefly describe kind of what your typical day or week looks like?  Nada Miljkovic  12:28   Well it's interesting you asked me that Patrick because when I was in my late 20s, I went through career counseling up at San Francisco. It was started by women for women but it's opened up since then. I don't remember exactly the name of the career counseling program. But while I was going through the career counseling, they told me Nada, you know, you're a portfolio career kind of gal. And I was like, what does that mean? I don't understand. She says, you have so many interests, you have so many things that you want to do that having a 40 hour a week, one job is not going to make you happy, it's going to get you bored. And so you look like somebody that needs to have, let's say, Tuesdays and Thursdays you teach up at UCSC, teaching ethics right now and the Get Virtual class and then Mondays you do your nonprofit work . I'm the chair of the board of the Arts Council of Santa Cruz County.  Wednesdays you work on your digital art and your movies for my PhD.  Oh, I'm now helping with the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship development actually up at UCSC.  Oh, and I also teach online, I teach to high school students all over the world, through international institutes, both at Stanford and some friends of mine who have started a new startup. And so I've really taken to heart what that career counseling setup for me because once I went through the career counseling and I got my actually got my job at BART, I told them that I could only work 24 hours a week.  Those were my boundaries. That was how much time I could give for that. I also had small children So I had a lot of work there. And so, with that, I started really considering how to curate my life around my interests and and be able to make a living through doing basically my passions, the things that are most important to me.

Do you mind briefly, talking to us about some of your more favorite projects that you've worked on? Or are currently working on?  Nada Miljkovic  18:41   Well, I have had an incredibly privileged career. One of the things that I got to do was in this Stanford international institutes, where they sent me into the world to teach high school kids. And what I was teaching them was entrepreneurship, the simulation class, the Crown 90 that I was telling you about. Basically, I would teach the kids to brainstorm an idea formed teams around them, and then do customer discovery, interview people, gather qualitative data, analyze that data, and then apply that to their business model to see if they had the right assumptions. So you start with I think this is what's the business should look like. I think this is what the value propositions are. These are what the customer discovery, customer segments, I think this is what my customer relationships should be like, my revenue stream, my key resources, key partners, key activities, and, of course, at the end, how much all of it costs. And through the process, you're asking people if they think you have a good idea. I also introduce them to experts in the fields from whatever they're pursuing, and then also help them find mentors. These classes are usually two or three weeks long. And so I've have gotten to go to Chile and Peru and Colombia and Brazil and Mexico and Kazakhstan doing this.",

What makes an entrepreneur work and be successful? And it's risk takers.  You are taking a risk when you're starting your own business. You're, sometimes working seven days a week, all the time to keep your business going to figure out your your cash flow and revenue streams and hustle for your next project. Right?

Nada Miljkovic  24:42   Well, like I was saying, I feel like the Earth is in need of champions. And I'm not just an environmentalist, I'm also a social justice activist. I actually call myself an artivist. I use my art practice as my activism, and so with my environmentalism and my social justice activism, I really want to do as much as I can to both help people and help the earth , all living creatures.  And that's what I was saying about being choosy with who my cut my clients are. If my clients aren't in alignment with doing something that's going to make the world a better place in some way, not just taking, but actually giving back more, then I'm happy to help.",

And you know, when I read a lot of articles about how everything has been affecting the students, but I don't feel like I'm reading enough articles on how much it's affecting the teachers, too, because their workload has increased a lot with the online learning. Is that correct?  Nada Miljkovic  26:27   Well, the online learning, we're back in the classroom, but everyone's wearing masks, it's so hard to understand the students while they're wearing masks. I get a microphone and I share the microphone, but still,  having a discussion, having real dialogue is just hard. But it's not impossible. And I think what's really most important, if I was going to give students that are listening advice, is to really get to know yourself, do self exploration, find out what are your values? What are the things that you're really good at? What are your strengths? What are your most important values and strengths? And find a way to use those together",

Talk to people in positions that you want to, perhaps, experiment with. Find people that are really happy and in their jobs, and ask them about them. Talk to people, people love to talk about their jobs.",

So, you know, I grew up in Santa Cruz. I went to Bonnie doon Elementary and then Mission Hill, Santa Cruz High and I was not super interested in academics, you could say I was young for my grade. And so I didn't have the best grades in high school. I knew that I wanted to go to college, but no one in my family had gone to college before me. And so my mom's advice was always just talk to the counselors and so the counselors every semester, I would meet with them and they advised me to go to Cabrillo. And then at Cabrillo they helped me finish Cabrillo and four semesters. And I was always  really interested in traveling. And so I did a couple of trips abroad whilst being a student at Cabrillo during vacations and breaks. I wouldn't say I was super mature. I graduated high school when I was 17.   And so once I was ready to transfer, I was still only 19 years old. And so I ended up at UCSC. And I had no idea what I wanted to be. At Cabrillo I had a history class that I really liked. So I decided to major in history. And while I was at UCSC, it was funny because my mom was a bus driver up there. And so she had a parking pass because she would bike to work. And so I was parked in like the staff parking and so I never really made any friends while I was at UCSC. I just still kept my same friends from home from town. And so I just studied history, and I had two really great professors that I liked up there. And then I still didn't have a clue what I wanted to be. So when I graduated UCSC, my boyfriend at the time and I, This was the year 2000. We sold everything that we had, and we put some stuff up in a shed and Bonnie Doon that we wanted to keep. We sold our cars. And we bought a circle Pacific ticket and we traveled the South Pacific for a year.   And then when I got back, I was working a little bit at Pacific Wave just to make money and we moved back in with my parents and my dad was like, You need to get out, this is terrible. And so I was like shoot, I probably should start like figuring out a way to make a little more money. And while I was working at Pacific Wave, I ran into somebody that I knew who had just got a job substituting and he said that the county is super desperate for substitutes. And in fact, at his school at SLV, there was a person going out on maternity leave that was a history teacher and asked if I was maybe interested in taking a long term sub position at San Fernando Valley High School. And like I said I was young. I'm also super short. I'm not even five feet tall. And they asked and so they like snatched me up, I think because they were desperate. And so I started substituting in this high school class for juniors and seniors. It was a history class or a history teacher's class for the entire spring semester. And I really like apologize to those kids, if any of them are listening today. They're adults now but wow, I was terrible.   Like it was horrible. At one point one of the kids actually asked to go the bathroom in stole my keys and joyrided my car outisde. And the principal called me and said, Please don't let your car to students and I said Not only would I not lend the car to students, I don't let my boyfriend drive. It's my first brand new car. Like what? And so at the end of the year, there was three of us that were on emergency credentials, and they were so desperate, they were willing to like keep us on and let us do this internship program. And two of them stayed on and I think still work up there. I was like, No, I am the worst. Like there's no way I could do this. I'll be eaten alive. So I actually went back to school. I did however, like teaching, I just knew it wasn't the right fit. And so I went back to school and I went to CSUMB and got my credential that year. And it was a one year program and then as soon as I graduated, I went in the exact opposite direction. I went down to South County. I got a job teaching kindergarten, bilingual kindergarten in Pajaro and I taught there for five years. That's the exact opposite of high school. So that's kind of how I ended up as a teacher.",

You want to talk kind of about what your typical day or work looks like? And has that changed over the past two years? I think you told me before the interview that you're at school every day, even when it was on lockdown.   Rene Golder  12:41   Yeah, so how it's changed I think since the pandemic is I feel like I've gotten lazy or actually because I used to wake up at five religiously and go work out  whether it's running or Pilates or  something like that. Now, I feel like I'm a little slacker-ish. So, I try most days to wake up and do a workout before work. But sometimes I don't, I have to admit. And so I try to get to work by like 7:30. And then I'm here at school, until usually 3:30 to five most days. And throughout the day while I'm here, I'm in meetings, I'm in classrooms, I'm out on the playground, I'm talking to parents. I'm coordinating things that need to be done with the district office and that's kind of what it's like to be a principal. It's a little bit different than being in the classroom. And then after work, if I have any city council business, I take care of that, like meetings or things like that. If I don't, then I am just like most people, I go home and I check in with my kids. Luckily my kids are getting a little older so my son drives himself where he needs to go and my daughter sometimes bikes but just like most parents, I have to do carpool sometimes for different activities. And then I love eating at home. And so I make dinner probably four nights a week or maybe more and do family dinner. I'm really close with my sister and her husband and their kids. And actually one of them's a fifth grader here at Bayview. So we have dinner together three or four nights a week if possible. And then after dinner, I find myself checking emails responding to emails, and then it's just shower and bed. I'm in bed pretty early though. I'm a total bed troll.",

Rene Golder  15:34   I think, for some kids, it was, it was really difficult for sure. I'm pretty optimistic, though. I tried to see the good in what happened. And I feel like it was good for families to have time to connect with each other in ways that they hadn't before. I also felt like for families that didn't have access to technology, it was an opportunity for them to kind of close that digital gap that exists in our society. The other thing that I thought was good that came out of it was that oftentimes, I'd be working with students or see students online, and their parents would be sitting right beside them. And for some parents in our community, that maybe don't speak English fluently or don't have the education that others have had an opportunity to receive, it was a way for them to see that teaching their child reading and writing and math isn't magic and it's not something that they can't be part of.

And so a friend, Hilary Bryant, she was mayor at the time, and Lynn Robinson was on the council as well. And they wanted to put together a group of citizens, the public safety task force to help advise the council with a series of recommendations after studying some of the issues around public safety for close to a year. So they brought together like a diverse community group, and they wanted me to represent kind of education and youth in our community. And so I was asked to serve on that advisory body and I did. And I was really, interested in helping Santa Cruz in like a larger capacity at that point. But at that time, my kids were still young, and I had thought about running for counsel then and it was actually Hillary and Lynn that advised me not to they said It's really hard on the kids and hard on your family. And they said if they if they they were me, they would wait until my kids were a little bit older. And some of the rationale was that people say really nasty things about you and and it can affect the kids and so I really I respect them took parental heart and so I wanted to wait.   And so I was planning on running in a regular election. The last one that just happened. I don't know what year it was . 2020 I guess. But prior to that, there was the Recall Initiative that was moving forward. And there was nobody really stepping into run as an alternative if the recall passed, and I wasn't really thinking that the recall would pass, but they just kind of needed somebody, in case it did. And so I was like, Well, I may as well run now. And I can get my campaign committee organized. I can get my banking stuff in order and then I'll be set to go for the fall. And so that's kind of what I thought was gonna happen. And in fact, the recall, went through, and I won. And so there I was. I wasn't really expecting it. And even after the election, I didn't think I was going to win. And it wasn't until like, three weeks after the election when the votes were certified that I even believed that I didn't track the election daily or anything like that.

You want to talk kind of about what your typical day or work looks like? And has that changed over the past two years? I think you told me before the interview that you're at school every day, even when it was on lockdown. Rene Golder  12:41  Yeah, so how it's changed I think since the pandemic is I feel like I've gotten lazy or actually because I used to wake up at five religiously and go work out  whether it's running or Pilates or  something like that. Now, I feel like I'm a little slacker-ish. So, I try most days to wake up and do a workout before work. But sometimes I don't, I have to admit. And so I try to get to work by like 7:30. And then I'm here at school, until usually 3:30 to five most days. And throughout the day while I'm here, I'm in meetings, I'm in classrooms, I'm out on the playground, I'm talking to parents. I'm coordinating things that need to be done with the district office and that's kind of what it's like to be a principal. It's a little bit different than being in the classroom. And then after work, if I have any city council business, I take care of that, like meetings or things like that. If I don't, then I am just like most people, I go home and I check in with my kids. Luckily my kids are getting a little older so my son drives himself where he needs to go and my daughter sometimes bikes but just like most parents, I have to do carpool sometimes for different activities. And then I love eating at home. And so I make dinner probably four nights a week or maybe more and do family dinner. I'm really close with my sister and her husband and their kids. And actually one of them's a fifth grader here at Bayview. So we have dinner together three or four nights a week if possible. And then after dinner, I find myself checking emails responding to emails, and then it's just shower and bed. I'm in bed pretty early though. I'm a total bed troll",

There's a table and there's a there's like a standing cart thing that I'll use when I'm working on my computer but I prefer to be out and about at any anytime during the day. When I'm forced to sit, I do. But during the day I like to be out and about walking around through the campus.  For city council unfortunately, it's a 180 degree opposite because the majority of my city council responsibilities are responding to emails or sitting in meetings. And so that's that's actually a challenge for me.",

Do you want to talk about what kind of person do you think would enjoy being in either a city councilwoman or a principal of an elementary school?  Rene Golder  21:24   It's funny, because I think of myself more as a teacher than a principal, but I think of myself as like a Lead Teacher. I would think that someone that would want to go into education, whether it's administration or being a teacher would be somebody that appreciates having every day be a little bit different but yet the same.

I would think that someone that would want to go into education, whether it's administration or being a teacher would be somebody that appreciates having every day be a little bit different but yet the same. So you have your routine, right? You know, when your days off are gonna be. It's kind of a set schedule in that regard. But every day is gonna be a little bit different. And there's something weird that's going to happen and so there's always something to laugh about at dinner that happened at school. And so it's like  every day, I'm excited to go to work at school. I love my job at school. For city council, it's a little bit different, I think that it's for people that obviously are trying to make Santa Cruz the best place it can be and not everybody sees eye to eye on the way to get there. And so, you have to be able to be flexible, and willing to compromise and that can be frustrating at times. The other thing I think, in both worlds is things in government move at a glacial pace, and that can be frustrating for some people. And so that's something that's frustrating for me. And so sometimes I have to temper it down, because I want to move things along a lot faster.",

Patricia Greenway  1:24   I'll see you while I was in high school, I was mainly focused on going to the Art Institute of Chicago to be an interior designer. I've done a lot of research on interior design schools. And at that time, the Art Institute in Chicago was one of the best in the nation. My senior year in high school, I had the opportunity to do a regional occupational program class that was focused on interior design. And I discovered that interior design was a math based career. So I immediately backpedaled and decided I did not want to do interior design. Because I did not want to do math all day, every day. My father talked to me a lot about nursing school and encouraged me to enroll in nursing school because he said it's a good paying job. And it's a job that I could have security and I could go anywhere in the world and have a job and I would never be out of a job. And those were very, you know, valid points. So I enrolled in surgical nursing school. And I did one semester and I was fascinated with anatomy and medical terminology. But I really didn't like the fact that I was not going to have a creative outlet. I'm a very social person, a very creative person. So after that first semester, I kind of reassessed myself and discovered that I was really interested in business administration and marketing. So I ended up going to school for that. And that's kind of the career path that I followed. But as I tell a lot of my students, it's okay to make career changes in your lifetime. Because sometimes you get into a college program or career training program, or you get into a career itself, and you discover that it's not what you thought it was going to be, and you don't feel that it's going to make you happy. So I can attest that that happens many times to people in their life.",

For the Santa Cruz Symphony League? Yes. Okay. Do you want to talk about how long? How long have you been doing that? And what's that look like?     #SANTA CRUZ SYMPHONY LEAGUE'S MUSIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND FUNDRAISING EVENTS.     Patricia Greenway  10:27   I've been doing that for almost three years, something music is something I've always had a huge appreciation for. I love all genres of music, bluegrass, classical, I listened to rap and hip hop, I listened to languages, I listened to music and languages that I don't actually understand. But to me, music is such a universal language. You can just feel you know what the musician is playing or hear what the singer is singing and it brings out emotion and feelings that I just find fascinating. I got involved with the symphony League, I had been to a number of their events. I've been a season ticket holder with the Santa Cruz Symphony for eight years, nine years now, I believe. And shout out to Maestro Daniel Stewart. He's phenomenal. He's doing wonderful things with the Santa Cruz symphony. And I just have such love and appreciation for everything that he brings to the symphony and the community. But I wanted to get more involved outside of just being a season ticket holder with going to the concerts. And going to the fundraiser events, I've really wanted to help support the music education programs that the Santa Cruz Symphony does because they go into schools throughout Santa Cruz County and they work with the youth in our community and they really get them involved with music. And it's so nice to have that in the classroom. And I wanted to help fly you know, just raise money for that and and support that, that effort. And it's been so great working with the symphony staff and the Santa Cruz Symphony league volunteers and board members because they do such wonderful things in our community, not only with music, but just with a social event, you know, kind of mindset that they have. They have so many fun events that are just so exciting. You know, we go to the Laguna Siena Laguna Seca track, and we do these track tours. And we have lunch and I take my Porsche out there. And I'm able to, you know, just get out there and kind of let loose and it's really fun. But I'm also helping, like raise money for music education and the Santa Cruz symphony. They also do their annual gala, which is a lot of fun. You also, they always have these great bands at the gala and people dance. And it's just such a fun event. And the food is always wonderful. And it's always such a fun place to be because everyone's having a great time and just, you know, kind of there to fulfill, you know, the goal of raising money for the symphony and helping support music, education and the community. And then they also have the annual Home Tour, which is coming up this weekend. For those of you that are not familiar with the the symphony link Home Tour, it's happening November 20, and 21st. And we're gonna do the shops at the home tour at the Capitola community center. And then the home tour is going to go on for the month of November through December. So get your tickets online at Santa Cruz Symphony League website. And it's a great event this year, they're going to feature 10 homes throughout the Bay Area. And these homes are breathtaking. You would just not believe the homes that they have. It's just amazing. Cool. Yeah, it's a virtual event you can do from home in your pajamas while you're sipping coffee if you'd like. So it's it's it's a really fun event, you have to see these homes if you have like interior design or architecture or if you just want to help raise money for the symphony and music education. It's it's a great, great event.",

And I just think it's so great that they go into schools and really make such a positive impact. It sounds like in our community. Yeah, all     Patricia Greenway  14:18   of all of the money that the symphony raises every year 100% of that money goes directly to the symphony to help support the symphony and the musicians and the music education programs that they do. And it's just such a nice addition to our community to have a symphony     Patrick Hart  14:37   here. Okay, and now when you're racing around in your Porsche or around Laguna Seca, are you listening to Beethoven's Fifth or?             #Job fairs and employment support for people with disabilities.     Patricia Greenway  14:46   Oh, I that's that's a mixed bag for me. I may listen to you know, Beethoven. I may listen to I don't know i That's a mixed bag. For me. I mix it up.     Patrick Hart  15:00   But no matter what it is, it's probably pretty fun. Yeah,     Patricia Greenway  15:03   I listen to a lot of Frank Sinatra. I find Frank Sinatra really hits home for me, I can never be in a bad mood when I listen to him. I just want to sing and dance and he always puts me in a great mood. Yeah, agreed. I think Come fly with me is one of my favorite songs by Frank Sinatra. Very good",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Patrick Hart  15:19   song. And you know, so you're at Soquel, which is your, your paid job. But I just was gonna ask like, what, what kind of environments do you work in at Soquel? Are you in an office? Or are you out moving around campus? Or what's it look like?     Patricia Greenway  15:33   I do have an office and I do work with the special ed teacher. So I am in classrooms, often, I often will bring students into my office to meet with them privately if there are things that we want to work on like their resume or their applying for a job, or if they just need practice, with, you know, interviewing before they go to a job interview. I also meet one on one with students office, I just spent a lot of time floating around to the different special ed classrooms doing presentations and working with the students on you know, different activities. Okay.     Patrick Hart  16:05   And with access to employment, you talked about that you guys put on different like employment type like expos or something like career expos. Yes, we     Patricia Greenway  16:15   do an annual job fair every October. And we do it in October, because October is People With Disabilities Awareness one. And that's our main focus for access to employment is to really support employers who hire people with disabilities and support and to support people in our community who are job seekers that are looking for work that have disabilities. It's an annual job fair that's been going on since 1991. And last year, we had to do a Virtual Job Fair because of COVID restrictions, and you know, shelter, shelter and place restrictions. But it was a lot of fun. We worked very closely with Santa Cruz works who kind of helped us figure out the technical aspects of what platform to use for our virtual event and just kind of helped hold her hand and walk us through hosting a virtual event. It was something new for us as I think it was for many people in the world doing virtual events at that time. But we we had a great turnout with the number of job seekers that registered, I believe we had a record of over 400 job seekers that registered for our job fair. And we had more than a dozen, I believe employers who participated in the employers basically did a short presentation of their company and the work culture and talk about positions they're hiring for and what the hiring procedure was. So it was really nice for the job seekers to be able to hear that directly from those employers, instead of just trying to go to a website and fill out a job application and then never get a phone call. They could not only hear the presentation from the employer, but then we had breakout rooms where they could go and talk in small groups or one on one with those hiring managers from companies and kind of introduce themselves and ask questions directly to those hiring managers. Oh,     Patrick Hart  17:56   that sounds great. And congratulations on what it's what sounds like a successful event.     Patricia Greenway  18:01   Yeah, we were very happy. And it seemed like a lot of the employers and job seekers were very happy with the outcome of the event. And, you know, it was kind of a new thing for the companies and the job seekers to do a job fair online. So you know, it was nice to work with Santa Cruz works and have their support to help kind of walk us through that technical aspect of doing something new that we had never done before. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, we tried to set it up so that it was almost as if you were there in person at a live job fair. We wanted to do the breakout rooms so that people could go talk to hiring managers that they were interested in talking to and they didn't just have to hear the presentation, and then log in to try to fill out an online application or make a phone call to that hiring manager. They could just drop into the breakout room and introduce themselves and ask questions the same as you would if you went to a live in person job fair. And you kind of went to the employers that you were interested in talking to you would go to their exhibitor table and introduce yourself and present your resume and ask them questions and find out more about the workplace culture and what the hiring process was. Okay.",

So I think all three of those positions offer me a great opportunity to utilize both of those the creativity and the the social aspect of just my true character. I was I was a former automotive journalist. I've always enjoyed writing, and I love cars and racing. So it was something I was very interested in at one point. And I was an automotive journalist for gosh, for I think, almost five years. And it really helped me kind of fine tune my my writing skills. And I use a lot of that with my career development specialist job with Santa Cruz city schools, I have to do reports, annual reports and monthly reports for the special ed students that I work with for their IEP meetings. And, you know, needless to say, with a lot of the the marketing that I do for access to employment and the symphony League, that also entails a lot of writing, whether it's, you know, creating a brochure, or creating a flyer or creating something for a website or creating a social media post. There's there's always a lot of writing that I do, I would say almost on a daily basis. I also write a lot of letters to employers and donors trying to raise money for the symphony League and then just writing letters to employers for access to employment and Santa Cruz city schools to try to encourage them to get involved with hiring youth or hiring people with disabilities in our in our community. Well,",

Patricia Greenway  24:24   Yeah, I mean, I also do, you know, I, I developed a curriculum for employment preparation, not only for youth employment preparation, but I also developed an inmate employment preparation program with the Sheriff's Department. This was pre COVID. So I was going to two different jails in Santa Cruz County, working with inmates, helping them kind of prepare for reentry and finding employment and helping them get set up with things that they needed to do to secure employment and kind of reenter society. So you know, that obviously entailed a lot of writing but you know, With the workshops I do, there's a lot of resume and cover letter writing that I do with the inmates and the students that I work with. So that entails a lot of writing. So it takes a lot of skill for me to sit down with those folks and kind of coach them on using proper grammar using correct spelling, and you know how to word things when you're writing cover letters and resumes. And it's always fun for me to sit down with someone who says a student who says, I've never had a job, you're not gonna be able to do a resume for me, I have nothing to put on my resume. And then I sit down and I say, Okay, let's look at your qualifications. You're bilingual, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's put that on your resume. Huh? You have a food handler certification, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's put that on your resume. Let's see you've done babysitting. So you have your first aid and your CPR certification for babysitting, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's add that to your resume. Okay, let's move on. Let's look at your experience. Well, I've never had a job. I don't have any experience. Okay, well, that's not true. You've done volunteering, right? You've done fundraising for the cheerleading squad here at school.

So it's always interesting to sit down with a youth who has never really thought about what they could put on their resume, because they have this misconception that just because they've never had a job before that they can't write a resume.

And I think that's because you've done research and you've really assessed your career path. And you've looked at different options, and you've made the choice that you feel is best for you.

So parents, if you have students in middle school in high school, I strongly advise you to, you know, work with them to do career assessments, you can go online and look for career assessments, there are lots of free resources that you can do. Naviance is a great one, O*NET, RIASEC. Those are all great career assessments that you can do with your children at home.",

Christina Ortega  4:32   I am a first generation college student, I was the first of my family to go to higher education. I didn't really have an option. I didn't know what community college was. I didn't know the different opportunities that I would have had. It was just go to a four year and this is what you're gonna study.    I was a business major because that's what my family suggested that I'd be really good at. And I found myself really unhappy and unsatisfied with my courses. As I went to Fresno State right out of high school, lived in the dorms, and majored in business. And for the first time, I was not doing well in my classes because I was really unhappy with them. So as the true academic counselor, I looked through the catalog and looked for things that you know, started to look a little bit interesting and took electives that I may enjoy. And I decided to major in psychology.    As I was going through my psychology coursework, I thought, you know, what do I but there's so many opportunities to do with psychology, you don't necessarily have to be a psychologist. You're just learning how people think and how people interact with each other, so I got a part time job as like a peer advisor at Fresno State and I absolutely fell in love with it. And I knew that's what I wanted to study.    So then right after I graduated, my BA in psychology, I went on to get my Master's in Counseling. At that time, I thought I wanted to be a K through 12 Counselor. So I did all the coursework required to be a K through 12 counselor. I did my internship at a high school and a junior high, but my heart was in higher education and helping first generation students navigate higher education.    And so then I applied at Cabrillo, I was an evaluator. So basically I take incoming transcripts and I tell them what they mean for Cabrillo or what that means for transfer. And then shortly after that, I got hired at UCSC as a psychology advisor. But I knew that my heart was at the community college. So I'm very thankful that I had the opportunity to get hired on full time and make my way back to Cabrillo.",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  4:25   Absolutely. I was gonna ask you, do you want to talk about your education journey?   Christina Ortega  4:32   I am a first generation college student, I was the first of my family to go to higher education. I didn't really have an option. I didn't know what community college was. I didn't know the different opportunities that I would have had. It was just go to a four year and this is what you're gonna study.    I was a business major because that's what my family suggested that I'd be really good at. And I found myself really unhappy and unsatisfied with my courses. As I went to Fresno State right out of high school, lived in the dorms, and majored in business. And for the first time, I was not doing well in my classes because I was really unhappy with them. So as the true academic counselor, I looked through the catalog and looked for things that you know, started to look a little bit interesting and took electives that I may enjoy. And I decided to major in psychology.    As I was going through my psychology coursework, I thought, you know, what do I but there's so many opportunities to do with psychology, you don't necessarily have to be a psychologist. You're just learning how people think and how people interact with each other, so I got a part time job as like a peer advisor at Fresno State and I absolutely fell in love with it. And I knew that's what I wanted to study.    So then right after I graduated, my BA in psychology, I went on to get my Master's in Counseling. At that time, I thought I wanted to be a K through 12 Counselor. So I did all the coursework required to be a K through 12 counselor. I did my internship at a high school and a junior high, but my heart was in higher education and helping first generation students navigate higher education.    And so then I applied at Cabrillo, I was an evaluator. So basically I take incoming transcripts and I tell them what they mean for Cabrillo or what that means for transfer. And then shortly after that, I got hired at UCSC as a psychology advisor. But I knew that my heart was at the community college. So I'm very thankful that I had the opportunity to get hired on full time and make my way back to Cabrillo.",

And I know Cabrillo, at least, when I was there recently, when you made an appointment to see a counselor was a different counselor every time.

They said, \u201cOh, yeah, you can just email me directly,\u201d and that was awesome.    Christina Ortega  7:39   Yeah, shout out to Lauren Cole. She's a great friend of mine. But yeah, so we do encourage and facilitate that relationship where students continue to meet with the same counselor so they don't have to start their story all over again, because becomes frustrating, I would not want to go see a doctor, a new doctor every single time I always going to the doctor. You want to be able to build that rapport with that student and not and start your story all over again, and really build that connection with your counselor.

I think most importantly, being really open-minded and being able to listen to what the student is saying, and not assuming what they're thinking.

Christina Ortega  14:18   Yeah, I definetly because I was in their shoes, right. I was lost and confused and didn't understand what a unit count is, when the withdrawal deadline was, or how to fill out a FAFSA and that I could get financial aid to help me pay for school. I share that often with my students, and I make myself real to them and share my own background. That, you know, my parents immigrated to the United States, they worked in the fields. And so when I tell them that they begin to open up and they're just like, \u201cOh, you're one of me, you understand what I'm going through\u201d.

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  5:19   Do you want to share with us a little bit more about NBOG? And you know, because of the last few years, you know, there were a lot of different things happening. Did a school like that see, like, you know, maybe an influx of people may be wanting their children to attend a school maybe more something like that?   Kyle Vasquez  5:41   Yes, absolutely. And actually, I know, there's been, you know, and NBOG, where I've been teaching, has existed for almost 20 years. And we've been doing this for a really long time. And then when the pandemic happened, all of a sudden, there's like, many, many more nature groups in Santa Cruz, which is wonderful. Kids should be outdoors learning in nature, there's so many benefits to it. But yeah, we definitely saw more students and kind of different kinds of students, because we're traditionally a homeschool program. So historically, we kind of get a certain group of families who are homeschooling and value being in nature enough to spend like a whole day, every week, just out in the woods, even if it's raining, even if it's cold, we're out there. So it kind of brings a certain demographic, but one of the cool things about the pandemic was, we got to see families who were maybe homeschool families, but couldn't handle being on the computer all day every day. So I needed something else to kind of alleviate that, and ways that felt safer to be in groups and connect with other people.

So and then kids who were very young, I was working with five year olds who, you know, maybe can't even really remember times before in the before times, and then helping them kind of figure out how to be social for the first time it was, it was very interesting, as a teacher, academically, I was like, this is fascinating look at these children, but also just really beautiful to just watch people kind of like, like, breathe and open up.

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  5:19   Do you want to share with us a little bit more about NBOG? And you know, because of the last few years, you know, there were a lot of different things happening. Did a school like that see, like, you know, maybe an influx of people may be wanting their children to attend a school maybe more something like that?   Kyle Vasquez  5:41   Yes, absolutely. And actually, I know, there's been, you know, and NBOG, where I've been teaching, has existed for almost 20 years. And we've been doing this for a really long time. And then when the pandemic happened, all of a sudden, there's like, many, many more nature groups in Santa Cruz, which is wonderful. Kids should be outdoors learning in nature, there's so many benefits to it. But yeah, we definitely saw more students and kind of different kinds of students, because we're traditionally a homeschool program. So historically, we kind of get a certain group of families who are homeschooling and value being in nature enough to spend like a whole day, every week, just out in the woods, even if it's raining, even if it's cold, we're out there. So it kind of brings a certain demographic, but one of the cool things about the pandemic was, we got to see families who were maybe homeschool families, but couldn't handle being on the computer all day every day. So I needed something else to kind of alleviate that, and ways that felt safer to be in groups and connect with other people. And, and I think a lot of us just kind of forgot how to be with other people for a certain period of just being alone in our houses with our immediate families. And yeah, it was interesting kind of having the job of helping parents as well as kids kind of relearn how to be a community.

I got into some fancy drama schools in Hollywood and then went to Hollywood and realized I'm not really a city person.

And art doesn't have to be about the product to be valuable, right? Like, it can be. Like, I always think of like the Tibetan monks who make the beautiful mandala out of sand.

I do lots of portraits, and he was like five and was like, mine doesn't look like that. He's very smart. He's a good observer, and then just decided he can't do art, even though I tried to tell him he could. Sometimes your mom can't be the person to do that, though. And when he went to Seven Directions with the former owner of moss, who is an amazing person, someone finally was able to tell him what I'd been trying to tell him that like you are an artist, and you can make art and you can feel empowered to be an artist.

Like you make a little mockup. And then you put it on a giant wall. And it's like, oh, it's a totally different thing once it's 30 times the size. So I've done a bunch of murals way up and humble. And did a bunch of murals up there for people that saw me on Facebook and invited me out and then probably the mural of mine that people in Santa Cruz know the most is if you've ever seen a van driving around town covered in tide pool paintings. That one is mine. I made that one and that is one of my co-workers from NBOG. So cool. Yeah. So if you see your type, we'll have a rolling around Sanford because I painted that one.",

And it was just like, you know, someone I knew who gave me this chance to try this thing and really fun, it was. It's an epiphany to make art huge. It's so different, right? Like you make a little mockup. And then you put it on a giant wall. And it's like, oh, it's a totally different thing once it's 30 times the size. So I've done a bunch of murals way up and humble. And did a bunch of murals up there for people that saw me on Facebook and invited me out and then probably the mural of mine that people in Santa Cruz know the most is if you've ever seen a van driving around town covered in tide pool paintings. That one is mine. I made that one and that is one of my co-workers from NBOG. So cool. Yeah. So if you see your type, we'll have a rolling around Sanford because I painted that one.",
    "quote": "But yeah, I've been doing art professionally for a long time. I mean, I've been doing art since I was a small child, right. But I've started doing murals. Man, maybe eight years ago, time is weird. I don't I can't keep track of it. But I did a mural at a recording studio up in Felton of jazz musicians.",

All of our animals have, are very well trained to be around kids, and we know their personalities really well. A lot of them are rescues, but have been, you know, with kids since they were very small. So yeah, our seven foot boa constrictor is one of the friendliest creatures in the place. He just loves.

And I think one thing that might reflect a little on this is when I was at UC Santa Cruz, if you were in politics aboard you had a choice. You can either have comprehensive examinations where your professors barked theory questions at you for a few hours. Or you could write your undergraduate thesis. And that was not a choice for me. So I wrote an undergraduate thesis. And I wrote it on the history of water development in California. And I ended up being obsessed for six months and ended up getting honors in the thesis. I think it's why I got Honors at graduation, and now I have never been far from water policy my entire career. And so they're just certain things you do along the way. And yes, I've been a mayor and a Cabrillo trustee and Assembly Member and a cabinet secretary, although a cabinet secretary overwater, and now I'm back in the Senate.

He was here in Santa Cruz in the 1970s, his County Administrator, and he was just a meritorious person, he did things on the issues by the books, he had integrity in our office, he would excuse me, he would sort of give us direction and let us do it. And our big fear was, we would let him down. And he would do cover on the political side, while we were trying to do the facts are do the right thing. And the interesting thing is, when I talk about taking chances, you look at who was in that office in the 1970s, the criminal justice guy went on to be the chief administrator for the California Supreme Court. And one of the analysts and planning went on to head the planning for urban boundaries and things for King County, Washington. And one went on to be a county administrative officer, one went on to be the planning director, one went on to be the parks director, the one who stayed and was the budget officer for almost 30 years was a genius on budgeting in that and somebody went on to be the health director in Oregon. And so it turns out this young group was sort of hungry and was holding on to it, and I did whatever you could characterize my career as coming out of that. And the guy that was an intern, and then a young analyst became the 10th employee, at Clif Bar, and I think their attorney over the time, and it's done really well. And so it just, they were just risk taken, for hiring everyone. And we were young and good, and then went on to things and it's, you sort of can make a choice in an office to hire people like that. And it happened to me when I was resources secretary, my general counsel went to the Public Utilities Commission. Now she's head of the Air Board, and my Deputy Secretary for federal water is now head of the State Water Board. And the person that I, we hired to help with oil and gas is now the undersecretary of resources. And there are people all throughout the state government that are used to work with, it's very exciting. And if it's better to hire people that other people might want at some point, because that means they're good, and they're going to do a good job for you.",

    "transcript_excerpt_text": "Interviewer  16:12   Well, that's wonderful. And congratulations on that bill. That sounds fascinating. Was it signed in Palais Holden's, that was?   John Laird  16:18   So that's another story. That's my hometown. That's where I lived till I was 17. And so I stood up and said, just before I made my comments on the climate bill, with the governor right there that this was a message to anybody that went to cave elementary school, or Springsteen, junior high school, or Hogan high school that you two could go into the legislature author a big bill and have the governor come to your hometown to sign it and everybody cheered. And then he was asked in the question period, why he chose to sign the climate villas in Vallejo. And he said, Senator Laird would want nothing else. And I thought, oh, man, I'm just golden and Phileo. All my friends and Phileo social media have been exploding since that happened. And you know, you asked you teed up that one, but there's one other one. And it's really timely, and I might have talked about it with Rachel and Goodman, but the Watsonville hospital bill this year. And it's just an unbelievable circumstance. I mean, I played a monumental role, but it was the community that really stepped up in an unbelievable way. But, you know, near the end of last year, the hedge fund that ran Watsonville hospital announced they were bankrupt, they were going to close it. I remember hearing that, yeah, lay everybody off. And so in January, I did a bill at 19 days to create a hospital district. And normally bills took seven months, 90 days, we got it through both houses and to the governor's desk and he signed it. And when the public hospital district was five days old, the bankruptcy court accepted their bid for the hospital. And then the community and all of us had seven months to raise $65 million, which would cover the purchase cost and also the operating deficit for the bulk of the first year. And that was raised and the purchase was finalized on the last day of August. They even sent me the Certificate of sale and Robert Rivas and I got 25 million in the state budget this year. So we made sure the state did 25 million, and then 40 million was really matched by the agencies or individuals in this area. That hospital employs over 600 people, it's the basic care for a disadvantaged community. And they would have had to go for health care to Dominican and Santa Cruz or Netivot, ADRA. Salinas Valley Memorial and Salinas. I mean, there could have been loss of life that happened. And so that is just a monumental victory. Now, of course, we have to make work, but I think it's on the path. And that is, it is just exciting. Because I think I'm just at that point in my career where I feel skilled, if I know what I have to do, I'm really gonna do it. There was one key time where there was a legislator in the other house, and I had to say, can't say, every word that I said on the air, but get the blank out of the way, just get the blank out of the way we're gonna do this. And that person got out of the way and the bill moved, and here we are. So, I mean, I think that right, it's great because the Watsonville hospital closed on the day that all the climate bills got out of the legislature at the end of session. It was like everything. I had this other bill that made sure that kids of Sergeant Damon got Swidler and Elizabeth Butler of the Santa Cruz Police Department got their full survivor's benefits because I As the officers and the parents were killed in the line of duty, but they weren't married to their spouses. And so the kids that survived did not get the full survivor's benefits that a kid would get in that instance. And so I did a bill that recognized the different family pattern. A lot went retroactive, got them covered. And the governor signed it on the same day that Watsonville hospital closed and the climate bills got out. And so on your roll? Yeah. I mean, I told you beforehand, I feel like I'm running on fumes right now. And yet, because good things have.",

John Laird  22:14   Well, Florida, but also I went to work for a member of Congress, who ironically, was running against Jerry Brown for governor the first time when I graduated from UCSC. And when I was interviewed by Jerry Brown to be in his cabinet, and he's looking at my resume, I was thinking, Oh, how's this gonna go? And he says, that was the last person to run for governor that had integrity, that didn't pull everybody to find out what they thought. I imagined what he thought. And I thought that was fascinating that he said that I was glad because it was good for me moving ahead. But it was an interesting statement about Jerry Brown and my interview with him. I haven't pulled it out lately, but it was so fascinating. It was supposed to go half an hour, and it went two hours. And over the next week, I tried to write down as much as I could remember. And one of my favorite stories is that he says, when I was mayor of Oakland, people wanted to make sure I appointed this very large percentage of African American commissioners and things. And now, people are asking that I appoint a significant percentage of Latino Californians, you don't appear to present much diversity. And he looks across the table. He says that. So I hold up my hand and I show him my wedding ring. And I said, I'm one half of one of the 18,000 couples who got married in 2008, whose marriage stood because you stood up with Kamala Harris and made sure the Court affirmed that and he said, Oh, we are so over represented with gay people. And I thought I would never live long enough to hear somebody say that too. Because that was another thing that I don't think, you know, when I was elected mayor in Santa Cruz, which will be 39 years ago this November, I was one of the first three openly gay mayors in the history of the United States. And when I was, you know, thinking, in high school or college, I mean, I'm not sure that I knew how much that was going to be a part of the universe. When I graduated from UCSC, it was still against the law to be gay in all 50 states. And yet, there's another thing I look back on with gay pride, great pride, because, you know, I did what I thought was right, I wasn't sure. I was gonna be on the right side of history.

Because I think it starts to give you experience, but it also starts to tell you what you like. And I think this is true for anybody broader than politics. Hopefully, you find something that just motivates you every day. It's really interesting. I mean, one of the joys for me about my particular job is it's always different. You know, the, the, my Undersecretary noise secretary was so afraid I'd be in Santa Cruz because I'm here during the weekend. I'd be in Santa Cruz whenever a major disaster comes and I could never get out of here. And then lo and behold, it's it's a winter I think, 2017 It's the first weekend it hasn't rained in a month, I go out and we're actually in the yard because we haven't been able to be in the yard and I come in about five o'clock and my water deputy calls and says there's this thing going on at Oroville Dam. And then the Cal Fire Chief calls and says they just evacuated 180,000 People know the governor's office called and said Get the hell up here. At 11 o'clock that night, I was briefing 120 legislators or staff members about what was going on at Oroville Dam. And so that's the other thing. It's different, but you're never quite sure what's gonna happen. I didn't know how every day was going to end for about two weeks when that was going on. And so yeah.",

Dean Bussiere  1:14   I grew up in a big family. We were a Brady Bunch and I had five sisters and three brothers. Both my parents worked. So I started cooking as a kid just to feed myself. And my first job was at the local dairy bar. I started as a dishwasher prep cook and really loved it worked my way up quickly. I was a line cook within two years and eventually learned everything there was in that business and then moved on and ended up in school for aeronautical engineering at UConn, but I was putting myself through school, cooking, and realized I didn't want to be an engineer. I preferred to be on my feet and the creativity that Culinary Arts allowed me was much more satisfying. So I dropped out and went to resort Yacht Harbor down in Florida, off of the keys and did two years down there and got into the Culinary Institute of America finally went up to Hyde Park, New York and was working my way through school and was able to graduate with an associate's degree within two years and debt free, because I worked the whole time and paid in advance for my classes. So that was a very smart move on my part. I didn't realize it at the time responsible, but never looked back. I came to the west coast to work at the Ahwahnee hotel when I graduated and was up in Yosemite National Park for six years. Ended up as executive chef at the Wawona hotel. And that's where I met my wife, Wendy, and we moved down here in 2000. And now have three boys and beautiful home here in Santa Cruz and just love it.",

It was 12 to midnight, and those long hours and late nights. So when we had our third kid, my wife was like, Hey, you gotta get a day job. And just at that same time, I was executive chef at the shadowbrook restaurant here in town and Dominican hospital put up an ad for a chef to run their department for the first time. And so I interviewed for that and ended up getting the position and spent eight years there. And then I went into long term care over the hill.

So it promoted me a sense into the chef position. All I really wanted to do is cook great food. But all my co workers would be like, well, you should be the chef.

If I had continued to cook hard and do well, I probably would have still ended up as an executive chef. But not as quickly. I was an executive chef, by the time I was 24. And my having that degree really helped me. Then I also joined the American Culinary Federation, and started building a circle of friendship, influence, whatever you want to say. And so it's important to never burn bridges. Always, if you do leave a job, give notice and do it gracefully. And, gosh, interviewing is important. start documenting your achievements.
